          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>After a densely packed <span class="caps">WWDC</span> keynote with many new features for developers and user, Apple also published a new version of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">App Store Review Guidelines</a>. There are many changes ranging from minor rephrasings to totally new&nbsp;rules.</p>
<p>A few notable changes and additions that caught my&nbsp;mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>New note on how to respond to App Store customer&nbsp;reviews.</li>
<li>Note saying developers must now use the provided <span class="caps">API</span> to prompt users for reviews rather than link to the App Store page from a custom&nbsp;prompt.</li>
<li>App names can now only be 30 characters long. Previosly this limit was 50 characters. There is a new subtitle feature in iTunes Connect that we should use instead of long descriptive&nbsp;titles.</li>
<li>Apps that provide a programming interface may now (in some cases) download and run code from the&nbsp;Internet.</li>
<li>Clarifications regarding <span class="caps">IAP</span> and other purchasing methods for “reader”&nbsp;apps.</li>
<li>Binary options trading apps are no longer&nbsp;allowed.</li>
<li>Apps created from a commercialized template or app generation service will be&nbsp;rejected.</li>
<li>Your app description should let people know what types of access (e.g. location, contacts, calendar, etc.) are requested by your app, and what aspects of the app won’t work if the user doesn’t grant&nbsp;permission.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the changes are listed below. Additions have green highlight and deletions have red highlight and&nbsp;strikeout.</p>

        <ul>


            <li><span class="insert">The App Store is a great way to reach hundreds of millions of people around the world.  If you build an app that you just want to show to family and friends, the App Store isn’t the best way to do that.  Consider Ad Hoc distribution or the Enterprise Program.  If you’re just getting started, learn more about the <a
                    href="/programs/">Apple Developer Program</a>.</span></li>


            <li><span class="delete">If your app looks like it was cobbled together in a few days, or you're trying to get your first practice app into the store to impress your friends, please brace yourself for rejection. We have lots of serious developers who don't want their quality apps to be surrounded by amateur hour.
			We will reject apps for any content or behavior that we believe is over the line. What line, you ask? Well, as a Supreme Court Justice once said, "I'll know it when I see it". And we think that you will also know it when you cross it.
			If you attempt to cheat the system (for example, by trying to trick the review process, steal user data, copy another developer's work, or manipulate ratings) your apps will be removed from the store and you will be expelled from the Developer Program.</span>

            the review process or trigger a rejection. This doesn’t replace the guidelines or guarantee approval, but
            making
            sure you can check every item on the list is a good start.<span class="insert"> If your app no longer functions as intended or you’re no longer actively supporting it, it will be removed from the App Store.  </span><a

        <p>If your app behaves in a way that risks physical harm, we may reject it. For example:</p>
        <ul class="no-bullet">
            <li><strong>1.4.1</strong> Medical apps that could provide inaccurate data or information, or that could be
                used for diagnosing or treating patients may be reviewed with greater scrutiny. <span class="delete">If your medical app has received regulatory clearance, please submit a link to that documentation with your app.</span>

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="insert">Apps must clearly disclose data and methodology to support accuracy claims relating to health measurements, and if the level of accuracy or methodology cannot be validated, we will reject your app.  For example, apps that claim to take x-rays, measure blood pressure, body temperature, blood glucose levels, or blood oxygen levels using only the sensors on the device are not permitted.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="insert">Apps should remind users to check with a doctor in addition to using the app and before making medical decisions. </span>
                    </li>

                </ul>
                If your medical app has received regulatory clearance, please submit a link to that documentation with
                your app.
            </li>

            <li><strong>1.4.3</strong> Apps <span class="delete">should not</span><span class="insert">that</span>
                encourage <span class="insert">consumption of tobacco products, </span>illegal<span class="delete"> or excessive consumption of drugs or alcohol; or encourage minors to consume</span>
                drugs, <span class="insert">or excessive amounts of </span>alcohol<span class="insert"> are not permitted on the App Store. Apps that encourage minors to consume any of these substances will be rejected. Facilitating the sale of marijuana</span>,
                <span class="delete">or </span>tobacco<span
                        class="delete">; and facilitating the sale of marijuana</span><span class="insert">, or controlled substances (except for licensed pharmacies)</span>
                isn’t allowed.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1.4.5</strong> Apps should not urge customers to use their devices in a way that contradicts
                safety documentation for Apple hardware, risking damage to the device or physical harm to people. For
                example, apps should not encourage placing the device under a mattress or pillow while charging<span
                        class="insert"> or perform excessive write cycles to the solid state drive</span>. Review <a

    <li id="accurate-metadata"><strong>2.3 Accurate Metadata</strong>

        <ul class="no-bullet">
            <li><strong>2.3.2</strong> If your app includes in-app purchases, make sure your app description,
                screenshots, and previews clearly indicate whether any featured items, levels, subscriptions, etc.
                require additional purchases.<span class="insert"> If you decide to promote in-app purchases on the App Store, ensure that the IAP Display Name and Description are written for a public audience and that your app properly handles the Purchase Intent API so that customers can seamlessly complete the purchase when your app launches.</span>
            </li>
            <li><strong>2.3.3</strong> Screenshots should show the app in use, and not merely the title art, log-in
                page, or splash screen.<span class="insert"> They may also include text overlays and show extended functionality on device, such as Touch Bar.</span>
            </li>
            <li><strong>2.3.7</strong> Choose a unique app name, assign keywords that accurately describe your app, and
                don’t try to pack any of your metadata with trademarked terms, popular app names, or other irrelevant
                phrases just to game the system. App names must be limited to <span class="delete">50</span><span
                        class="insert">30</span> characters and should not include <span class="insert">prices, </span>terms<span
                        class="insert">,</span> or descriptions that are not the name of the app.<span class="insert">  App subtitles are a great way to provide additional context for your app; they must follow our standard metadata rules and should not include inappropriate content, reference other apps, or make unverifiable product claims.</span>
                Apple may modify inappropriate keywords at any time.
            </li>
            <li><strong>2.3.8</strong> Metadata should be appropriate for all audiences, so make sure your<span
                    class="insert"> app and in-app purchase</span> icons, screenshots, and previews adhere to a 4+ age
                rating even if your app is rated higher. For example, if your app is a game that includes violence,
                select images that don’t depict a gruesome death or a gun pointed at a specific character. <span
                        class="insert">Use of terms like “For Kids” and “For Children” in app names is reserved for the Kids Category. </span>Remember
                to ensure your metadata, including app name and icons (small, large, Apple Watch app, etc.), are similar
                to avoid creating confusion.

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>This update to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">App Store Review Guidelines</a> is mostly about the new iOS features SiriKit and Stickers, but also includes the previously promised new rules for subscription based apps. The full diff is listed below, but a few interesting new bits&nbsp;include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>App names must be limited to 50 characters and should not include terms or descriptions that are not the name of the&nbsp;app.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was also mentioned in the “App Store Improvements” email sent to developers on September 1<span class="ord">st</span> and will be enforced for new apps and app&nbsp;updates.</p>
<p>Section 3.2.2 has a new point that I think is worth to&nbsp;notice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apps should allow a user to get what they’ve paid for without performing additional tasks, such as posting on social media, uploading contacts, checking in to the app a certain number of times, etc. <strong>Apps should not force users to rate the app, review the app, download other apps, or take other similar actions in order to access functionality, content, or use of the&nbsp;app.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems to me that many apps and games currently encourage users to rate the app by offering rewards like free coins or similar for doing so. It will be interesting to see if Apple enforce this rule in a way that also prohibits this behavior where users are not forced, but gets&nbsp;rewarded.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And remember that even after your app has been approved, you should update your app to ensure it remains functional and engaging to new and existing customers. Apps that stop working or offer a degraded experience may be removed from the App Store at any&nbsp;time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes Apple will finally start to remove abandoned apps from the App Store. This should be a win for&nbsp;everyone.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/2016-06-13-totally-rewritten-wwdc/">Totally rewritten after WWDC keynote</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>What a keynote! Apple announced significant updates for their 4 big platforms: iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. And right after the keynote ended the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">App Store Review Guidelines</a> were also updated. But not just updated… Totally rewritten! The previous 30 sections have been reduce to only 5 sections but the word count has gone up from around 5000 words to over 6000 words.
<br /><br /></p>
<p>This post will not include a diff showing what changed since <a href="http://www.appstorereviewguidelineshistory.com/articles/2016-04-19-carekit-apple-music">the last update in April</a> since basically <em>everything</em> changed.
<br /><br /></p>
<p>From the&nbsp;introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The guiding principle of the App Store is simple - we want to provide a safe experience for users to get apps and a great opportunity for all developers to be successful. We have updated the App Review Guidelines with that principle in mind. The guidelines themselves haven’t changed, but they are better organized and provide more context. On the following pages you will find guidelines arranged into five clear sections: Safety, Performance, Business, Design, and&nbsp;Legal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last week when <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2016/06/the_new_app_store">Apple told journalists that App Store Subscription Pricing would no longer be limited to apps with media content and services</a> there was <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2016/06/app_store_subscription_uncertainty">much uncertainty to what that really meant</a>. The new guidelines actually elaborates on&nbsp;that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Auto-renewing subscriptions should only be offered using in-app purchase and may only be used for periodicals (e.g. newspapers, magazines), business apps (e.g. enterprise, productivity, professional creative, cloud storage), media apps (e.g. video, audio, voice, photo sharing), and other approved services (e.g. dating, dieting,&nbsp;weather)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I guess that means Apple have a whitelist of what kinds of apps will be allowed to use Subscription Pricing.
<br /><br /></p>
<p>Basically you should read the new guidelines from start to end. If you stumble upon new rules that were not mentioned before, then please let us know so we can update this&nbsp;post.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/2016-04-19-carekit-apple-music/">New Apple Music API section, CareKit and other updates</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Today Apple once again updated the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">App Store Review Guidelines</a>. It’s been 6 months since the last update, and the recent <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniOS/Articles/iOS9_3.html">iOS 9.3 release added several new developer APIs</a>; so this update was not unexpected.
<br /><br /></p>
<p>Most significant is perhaps the new section 10.8 that states apps using background location services must provide a reason for doing so. What Apple considers a fair reason is not really clear although the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/index.html"><span class="caps">HIG</span></a> is mentioned.
<br /><br /></p>
<p>Another significant addition is the new section 30 about the Apple Music <span class="caps">API</span> that was introduced in iOS 9.3. As described in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniOS/Articles/iOS9_3.html">iOS 9.3 release note</a> the new <span class="caps">API</span> allows 3<span class="ord">rd</span> party apps to add music to a user’s Apple Music library and play&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The update did also include some minor additions mentioning new Apple products such as CareKit and Apple Music in various sections. Additions are highlighted in green&nbsp;below.</p>

The changes listed below are mostly related to the release of the new Apple <span class="caps">TV</span>, but the new Apple Pencil also gets a mention.
<br /><br /></p>
<p>The new section 2.27 is rather confusing in its mention of the new Siri remote without explaining that the section only applies to tvOS apps (which we assume).
<br /><br /></p>
<p>The updated section 3.6 now says that tvOS top shelf extensions must only show content that adhere to the 4+ age rating. This basically means that we should be very careful with using any user generated content for the top&nbsp;shelf.</p>
