Make sure your app has been tested on-device for bugs and stability before you submit it, and include demo account info (and turn on your back-end service!) if your app includes a login. If you <span class="insert">are unable to provide a demo account due to legal or security obligations, you may include a built-in demo mode in lieu of a demo account with prior approval by Apple. Ensure the demo mode exhibits your app’s full features and functionality. If you </span>offer in-app purchases in your app, make sure they are complete, up-to-date, and visible to the reviewer, or that you explain why not in your review notes. Please don’t treat <span class="nowrap">App Review</span> as a software testing service. We will reject incomplete app bundles and binaries that crash or exhibit obvious technical problems.</p>

<p>Mainly, Apple now allows for streaming game services as long as the included games can be downloaded directly from the App Store. Apple has also clarified that so-called “Reader apps”, like Netflix, can offer account creation for free tiers, and they’ve now made it more clear that having hidden, dormant or undocumented features in apps are not allowed, an obvious reference to the Fortnite situation.</br></br></p>
<p>The complete changes can be seen&nbsp;below:</p>

	<li data-sidenav="2.3 Accurate Metadata" id="accurate-metadata"><span id="2.3"></span><strong>2.3 Accurate Metadata</strong>
		<p>Customers should know what they’re getting when they download or buy your app, so make sure your app description, screenshots, and previews accurately reflect the app’s core experience and remember to keep them up-to-date with new versions.</p>
		<ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
			<li id="2.3.1"><strong>2.3.1</strong> Don’t include any hidden<span class="insert">, dormant,</span> or undocumented features in your app; your app’s functionality should be clear to end<span class="delete">-</span> users and <span class="nowrap">App Review.</span><span class="insert"> All new features, functionality, and product changes must be described with specificity in the Notes for Review section of </span><span class="nowrap"><span class="insert">App Store Connect</span></span><span class="insert"> (generic descriptions will be rejected) and accessible for review.</span> Similarly, you should not market your app on the <span class="nowrap">App Store</span> or offline as including content or services that it does not actually offer (e.g. iOS-based virus and malware scanners). Egregious or repeated behavior is grounds for removal from the Developer Program. We work hard to make the <span class="nowrap">App Store</span> a trustworthy ecosystem and expect our app developers to follow suit; if you’re dishonest, we don’t want to do business with you.</li>
			<li id="2.3.7"><strong>2.3.7</strong> Choose a unique app name, assign keywords that accurately describe your app, and don’t try to pack any of your metadata with trademarked terms, popular app names, <span class="insert">pricing information, </span>or other irrelevant phrases just to game the system. App names must be limited to 30 characters and should not include prices, terms, or descriptions that are not the name of the app. App subtitles are a great way to provide additional context for your app; they must follow our standard metadata rules and should not include inappropriate content, reference other apps, or make unverifiable product claims. Apple may modify inappropriate keywords at any time or take other appropriate steps to prevent abuse.</li>

<p>The complete changes can be seen&nbsp;below:</p>
</section><p class="changes"><section class="apple">
  <strong>1.1 Objectionable Content</strong>
  <p>
    Apps should not include content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting,
    intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy.
    Examples of such content include:
  </p>
  <ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
    <li id="1.1.1">
      <strong>1.1.1</strong> Defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited
      content, including references or commentary about religion, race, sexual
      orientation, gender, national/ethnic origin, or other targeted groups,
      particularly if the app is likely to humiliate, intimidate, or
      <span class="delete">place</span><span class="insert">harm</span> a
      targeted individual or group<span class="delete"> in harm’s way</span>.
      Professional political satirists and humorists are generally exempt from
      this requirement.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="delete"><strong>1.1.7</strong> App Store Reviews:</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="delete"
        >App Store customer reviews can be an integral part of the app
        experience, so you should treat customers with respect when responding
        to their comments. Keep your responses targeted to the user’s comments
        and do not include personal information, spam, or marketing in your
        response.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="delete"
        >Use the provided API to prompt users to review your app; this
        functionality allows customers to provide an App Store rating and review
        without the inconvenience of leaving your app, and we will disallow
        custom review prompts.</span
      >
    </li>
  </ul>

  <strong>1.2 User Generated Content</strong>
  <p>
    Apps with user-generated content or services that end up being used
    primarily for pornographic content,
    <span class="insert">Chatroulette-style experiences, </span>objectification
    of real people (e.g. “hot-or-not” voting), making physical threats, or
    bullying do not belong on the App Store and may be removed without notice.
    If your app includes user-generated content from a web-based service, it may
    display incidental mature “NSFW” content, provided that the content is
    hidden by default and only displayed when the user turns it on via your
    website.
  </p>

  <strong>3.1 Payments</strong>
  <ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
    <li

      ><strong>3.1.3(b) Multiplatform Services:</strong> Apps that operate

      subscriptions, or features they have acquired
      <span class="delete">elsewhere</span
      ><span class="insert"
        >in your app on other platforms or your web site</span
      >, including consumable items in multiplatform games, provided those items
      are also available as in-app purchases within the app. You must not
      directly or indirectly target iOS users to use a purchasing method other
      than in-app purchase, and your general communications about other
      purchasing methods must not discourage use of in-app purchase.

          >
            Existing apps must comply with this guideline in any update
            submitted after January 1, 2019.</span
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <strong>4.3 Spam</strong>
  <p>
    Don’t create multiple Bundle&nbsp;IDs of the same app. If your app has
    different versions for specific locations, sports teams, universities, etc.,
    consider submitting a single app and provide the variations using in-app
    purchase. Also avoid piling on to a category that is already saturated; the
    App Store has enough fart, burp, flashlight,
    <span class="insert">fortune telling, dating, </span>and Kama Sutra apps,
    etc. already.
    <span class="insert"
      >We will reject these apps unless they provide a unique, high-quality
      experience. </span
    >Spamming the store may lead to your removal from the Developer Program.
  </p>

  <strong>4.5 Apple Sites and Services</strong>
  <ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
    <li id="4.5.4">
      <strong>4.5.4</strong> Push Notifications must not be required for the app
      to function, and should not be used
      <span class="delete"
        >for advertising, promotions, or direct marketing purposes or </span
      >to send sensitive personal or confidential information.
      <span class="insert"
        >Push Notifications should not be used for promotions or direct
        marketing purposes unless customers have explicitly opted in to receive
        them via consent language displayed in your app’s UI, and you provide a
        method in your app for a user to opt out from receiving such messages. </span
      >Abuse of these services may result in revocation of your privileges.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <strong>4.7 HTML5 Games, Bots, etc.</strong>
  <p>
    Apps may contain or run code that is not embedded in the binary (e.g.
    HTML5-based games, bots, etc.), as long as code distribution isn’t the main
    purpose of the app, the code is not offered in a store or store-like
    interface, and provided that the software (1) is free or purchased using
    in-app purchase; (2) only uses capabilities available in a standard WebKit
    view (e.g. it must open and run natively in Safari without modifications or
    additional software); your app must use WebKit and JavaScript Core to run
    third-party software and should not attempt to extend or expose native
    platform APIs to third-party software; (3) is offered by developers that
    have joined the <span class="nowrap">Apple Developer</span> Program and
    signed the <span class="nowrap">Apple Developer</span> Program License
    Agreement; (4) does not provide access to real money gaming, lotteries, or
    charitable donations; (5) adheres to the terms of these App Review
    Guidelines (e.g. does not include objectionable content); and (6) does not
    <span class="delete">support</span><span class="insert">offer</span> digital
    <span class="delete">commerce</span
    ><span class="insert">goods or services for sale</span>. Upon request, you
    must provide an index of software and metadata available in your app. It
    must include <span class="nowrap">Apple Developer</span> Program Team IDs
    for the providers of the software along with a URL which App Review can use
    to confirm that the software complies with the requirements above.
  </p>

  <strong>4.8 Sign in with Apple</strong>
  <p>
    Apps that <span class="delete">exclusively </span>use a third-party or
    social login service (such as Facebook Login, Google Sign-In, Sign in with
    Twitter, Sign In with LinkedIn, Login with Amazon, or WeChat Login) to set
    up or authenticate the user’s primary account with the app must also offer
    Sign in with Apple as an equivalent option. A user’s primary account is the
    account they establish with your app for the purposes of identifying
    themselves, signing in, and accessing your features and associated services.

Newly submitted kids apps must follow these guidelines immediately, while existing apps will have until March 3, 2020 to be fully compliant. Regarding <em>Sign in with Apple</em>, the guidelines now state that any apps that use a third-party login service, e.g. Facebook or Google, must also offer <em>Sign in with Apple</em>.<br/><br/></p>

Here’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=06032019j">Apple’s own summary</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guidelines 1.3 and 5.1.4.</strong> In order to help keep kids’ data private, apps in the kids category and apps intended for kids cannot include third-party advertising or analytics software and may not transmit data to third parties. This guideline is now enforced for new apps. Existing apps must follow this guideline by September 3,&nbsp;2019.</li>
<li><strong>Guideline 4.7.</strong> <span class="caps">HTML5</span> games distributed in apps may not provide access to real money gaming, lotteries, or charitable donations, and may not support digital commerce. This functionality is only appropriate for code that’s embedded in the binary and can be reviewed by Apple. This guideline is now enforced for new apps. Existing apps must follow this guideline by September 3,&nbsp;2019.</li>
<li><strong>Guideline 5.4.</strong> Because <span class="caps">VPN</span> provides access to sensitive data, VPN apps may not sell, use, or disclose to third parties any data for any purpose, and must commit to this in their privacy policy. Certain types of apps — such as those for parental control, content blocking, and security — from approved providers may use the NEVPNManager&nbsp;API.</li>
<li><strong>Guideline 5.5. (New)</strong> Because <span class="caps">MDM</span> provides access to sensitive data, MDM apps must request the mobile device management capability, and may only be offered by commercial enterprises, such as business organizations, educational institutions, or government agencies, and, in limited cases, companies utilizing MDM for parental controls. MDM apps may not sell, use, or disclose to third parties any data for any purpose, and must commit to this in their privacy&nbsp;policy.</li>
<li><strong>Guideline 5.1.3(i).</strong> Apps may use a user’s health or fitness data to provide a benefit directly to that user, such as a reduced insurance premium, if the app is submitted by the entity providing the benefit and the data is not shared with a third party. The developer must also disclose to the user the specific health data collected from the&nbsp;device.</li>
<li><strong>Guideline 5.1.1(viii) (New).</strong> Apps that compile information from any source that is not directly from the user or without the user’s explicit consent, even public databases, are not permitted on the App&nbsp;Store.</li>
<li><strong>Guideline 5.1.1(ii).</strong> Apps must get consent for data collection, even if the data is considered anonymous at the time of or immediately following&nbsp;collection.</li>
<li><strong>Guideline 1.1.3.</strong> Apps may not facilitate purchase of&nbsp;ammunition.</li>
<li><strong>Guideline 4.2.7.</strong> Remote desktop clients now include game consoles owned by the user. Software appearing in the client must be fully executed on the host device.
Demo videos of app functionality that is geo-locked or otherwise restricted are not accepted. Developers must provide a fully functional app for&nbsp;review.</li>

				<h3 class="typography-subsection-headline">Introduction</h3>
				<p>The guiding principle of the <span class="nowrap">App Store</span> is simple - we want to provide a safe experience for users to get apps and a great opportunity for all developers to be successful. <span class="insert">We do this by offering a highly curated </span><span class="nowrap"><span class="insert">App Store</span></span><span class="insert"> where every app is reviewed by experts and an editorial team helps users discover new apps every day.

		<strong>1.4 Physical Harm</strong>

<ul>
<li>Apps now must clearly describe new features and changes in the “What’s New” section of the App Store. Several of the large social network companies have been using a practice where they reuse a generic update text for every release and then enable new features remotely on a per-user basis. This appears to no longer be&nbsp;permitted.</li>
<li>Developers are now allowed to provide time based free trials for non-subscription&nbsp;apps.</li>
<li>Several new rules for apps dealing with cryptocurrencies. Apps are not allowed to mine coins, but in return cryptocurrencies no longer need to be&nbsp;“approved”.</li>
<li>New rules for apps and games with advertising. Users now must be able to see all information used to target an ad without leaving the&nbsp;app.</li>
<li>New rules for apps that enable Remote Desktop&nbsp;access.</li>
<li>Emojis are back! Section 4.5.6 says that it is ok to use Unicode characters that render as Apple emojis inside apps and app&nbsp;metadata.</li>
<li>All apps must include a link to their privacy policy in the App Store Connect metadata field and within the&nbsp;app</li>
<li>Apps must respect the user’s permission settings and not attempt to manipulate, trick, or force people to consent to unnecessary data access. For example, apps that include the ability to post photos to a social network must not also require microphone access before allowing the user to upload&nbsp;photos.</li>
<li>Apps that enable sign in using a 3<span class="ord">rd</span> party social network must also include a mechanism to revoke social network credentials and disable data access between the app and social network from within the&nbsp;app.</li>
<li>There is a new Developer Code of Conduct&nbsp;section.</li>

<h3 class="typography-subsection-headline">Introduction</h3>


        <p>The guiding principle of the App&nbsp;Store is simple - we want to provide a safe experience for users to get apps
            and a great opportunity for all developers to be successful.
            <span class="delete">We have updated the App Review Guidelines with that principle in mind. The</span>
            <span class="insert">On the following pages you will find</span> guidelines
            <span class="delete">themselves haven’t changed, but they are better organized and provide more context. On the following pages you
                will find guidelines </span>arranged into five clear sections: Safety, Performance, Business, Design, and
            Legal. A few other points to keep in mind:</p>
        <ul class="disc top-level">
            <li>
                <span class="insert">You are responsible for making sure everything in your app complies with these guidelines, including ad networks,
                    analytics services, and third-party SDKs, so review and choose them carefully.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We hope these
            <span class="delete">new </span>guidelines help you sail through the App Review process, and that approvals and rejections
            <span class="delete">are more</span>
            <span class="insert">remain</span> consistent across the board. This is a living document; new apps presenting new questions may result
            in new rules at any time. Perhaps your app will trigger this. We love this stuff too, and honor what you do.
            <span class="delete">We're</span>
            <span class="insert">We’re</span> really trying our best to create the best platform in the world for you to express your talents
            and make a living, too.</p>



        <strong>1.5 Developer Information</strong>
        <p>People need to know how to reach you with questions and support issues. Make sure your
            <span class="insert">app and its </span>Support URL
            <span class="delete">includes</span>
            <span class="insert">include</span> an easy way to

            <span class="insert">contact</span> you
            <span class="insert">; this is particularly important for apps that may be used in the classroom</span>. Failure to include accurate
            and up-to-date contact information not only frustrates customers, but may violate the law in some countries.
            Also ensure that Wallet passes include valid contact information from the issuer and are signed with a dedicated
            certificate assigned to the brand or trademark owner of the pass.</p>

        <strong>
            <span class="insert">1.6 Data Security</span>
        </strong>
        <p>
            <span class="insert">Apps should implement appropriate security measures to ensure proper handling of user information collected pursuant
                to the Apple Developer Program License Agreement and these Guidelines (see Guideline 5.1 for more information)
                and prevent its unauthorized use, disclosure, or access by third parties.</span>

                <span class="insert"> If your app includes media that requires the display of content ratings or warnings (e.g. films, music, games,
                    etc.), you are responsible for complying with local requirements in each territory where your app is
                    available.

<h3 class="typography-subsection-headline">Introduction</h3>

<p>We <span class="insert">strongly support all points of view being represented on the App Store, as long as the apps are respectful to users
            with differing opinions and the quality of the app experience is great. We </span>will reject apps for any content
        or behavior that we believe is over the line. What line, you ask? Well, as a Supreme Court Justice once said, “I'll
        know it when I see it”. And we think that you will also know it when you cross it.</p>

        <strong>2.1 App Completeness</strong>
        <p>Submissions to App Review<span class="insert">, including apps you make available for pre-order,</span> should be final versions with all necessary metadata
            and fully functional URLs included; placeholder text, empty websites, and other temporary content should be scrubbed
            before submission. Make sure your app has been tested on-device for bugs and stability before you submit it,
            and include demo account info (and turn on your back-end service!) if your app includes a login. If you offer
            in-app purchases in your app, make sure they are complete, up-to-date, and visible to the reviewer, or that you
            explain why not in your review notes. Please don’t treat App Review as a software testing service. We will reject
            incomplete app bundles and binaries that crash or exhibit obvious technical problems.</p>

        <strong>2.3 Accurate Metadata</strong>
        <ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
            <li>
                <strong>2.3.2</strong> If your app includes in-app purchases, make sure your app description, screenshots, and previews
                clearly indicate whether any featured items, levels, subscriptions, etc. require additional purchases. If
                you decide to promote in-app purchases on the App Store, ensure that the in-app purchase Display Name, Screenshot
                and Description are appropriate for a public audience
                <span class="insert">, that you follow the guidance found in </span>

                </a>
                <span class="insert">,</span> and that your app properly handles the

                </strong>
                <span class="insert"> Apps you submit for pre-order on the App Store must be complete and deliverable as submitted. Ensure that
                    the app you ultimately release is not materially different from what you advertise while the app is in
                    a pre-order state. If you make material changes to the app (e.g. change business models), you should
                    restart your pre-order sales.

            <li>
                <strong>2.5.1</strong> Apps may only use public APIs and must run on the currently shipping OS. Learn more about
                <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/">public APIs</a>. Keep your apps up-to-date and make sure you phase out any deprecated features, frameworks
                or technologies that will no longer be supported in future versions of an OS.
                <span class="insert">Apps should use APIs and frameworks for their intended purposes and indicate that integration in their app
                    description. For example, the HomeKit framework should provide home automation services; and HealthKit
                    should be used for health and fitness purposes and integrate with the Health app.</span>

But this update is actually rather big and includes many changes that does not relate to the new products as&nbsp;such.</p>
<p>A few notable changes and additions that caught my&nbsp;mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t market your app with features or content it does not have (such as claimed “virus&nbsp;scanners”)</li>
<li>You must support in-app purchases initiated from the App&nbsp;Store</li>
<li>Facial recognition for authentication must be implemented using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/localauthentication/">official Apple <span class="caps">API</span></a>.</li>
<li>Apps may facilitate peer-to-peer payments and are not required to use in-app purchases for such payments as long as no digital content or services are offered in exchange for rhe&nbsp;payment.</li>
<li>“Apps using ARKit should provide rich and integrated augmented reality experiences; merely dropping a model into an <span class="caps">AR</span> view or replaying animation is not&nbsp;enough.”</li>
<li>Section 4.7 changes some wording in the context of downloading and running 3<span class="ord">rd</span> party code from an&nbsp;app.</li>
<li>The list of app types that must include a privacy policy has been extended to also include “apps that utilize ARKit, Camera APIs, Photo APIs, or other software for depth of facial mapping information”. So if your app falls into this category make sure you have the privacy policy in place and save yourself for a&nbsp;rejection.</li>
<li>Data gathered from depth and/or facial mapping tools (e.g. ARKit, Camera APIs, or Photo APIs) may not be used for advertising or other use-based data&nbsp;mining</li>
<li>Don’t visualize activity data in a way that resembles the Activity Rings in Activity&nbsp;control</li>
<li><span class="caps">IAP</span> renamed to in-app purchases everywhere (not all cases included in the diff&nbsp;below)</li>
<li>Some typos were fixed (not all included in the diff&nbsp;below)</li>
<li>Various other changes; Check the details&nbsp;below.</li>
</ul>
</section><p class="changes"><section class="apple">
<strong>1.1 Objectionable Content</strong>
        <ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
            <li><strong>1.1.1</strong> Defamatory <span class="insert">, discriminatory,  </span>or mean-spirited content, including references or commentary about religion, race, sexual orientation, gender, <span class="insert">national/ethnic origin, </span>or other targeted groups, particularly if the app is likely to <span class="insert">humiliate, intimidate, or </span>place a targeted individual or group in harm’s way. Professional political satirists and humorists are generally exempt from this requirement.</li>
            
        </ul>


<strong>2.3 Accurate Metadata</strong>
        <ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
            <li><strong>2.3.1</strong> Don’t include any hidden or undocumented features in your app; your app’s functionality should be clear to end-users and App Review. <span class="insert">Similarly, you should not market your app on the App Store or offline as including content or services that it does not actually offer (e.g. iOS-based virus and malware scanners). </span>Egregious or repeated behavior is grounds for removal from the Developer Program. We work hard to make the App&nbsp;Store a trustworthy ecosystem and expect our app developers to follow suit; if you’re dishonest, we don’t want to do business with you.</li>
            <li><strong>2.3.2</strong> If your app includes in-app purchases, make sure your app description, screenshots, and previews clearly indicate whether any featured items, levels, subscriptions, etc. require additional purchases. If you decide to promote in-app purchases on the App Store, ensure that the <span class="delete">IAP</span><span class="insert">in-app purchase</span> Display Name<span class="insert">, Screenshot</span> and Description are <span class="delete">written</span><span class="insert">appropriate</span> for a public audience and that your app properly handles the <span class="delete">Purchase Intent API</span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skpaymenttransactionobserver/2877502-paymentqueue"><span class="insert">SKPaymentTransactionObserver method</span></a> so that customers can seamlessly complete the purchase when your app launches.</li>
            <li><strong>2.3.3</strong> Screenshots should show the app in use, and not merely the title art, log-in page, or splash screen. They may also include text <span class="insert">and image </span>overlays <span class="insert">(e.g. to demonstrate input mechanisms, such as an animated touch point or Apple Pencil) </span>and show extended functionality on device, such as Touch Bar.</li>
        </ul>



<strong>2.5 Software Requirements</strong>
        <ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">                                     
            <li><strong><span class="insert">2.5.13 </span></strong><span class="insert"> Apps using facial recognition for account authentication must use </span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/localauthentication/"><span class="insert">LocalAuthentication</span></a><span class="insert"> (and not ARKit or other facial recognition technology), and must use an alternate authentication method for users under 13 years old.</span></li>

<strong>3.2 Other Business Model Issues</strong>
        <ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
            <li id="acceptable"><strong>3.2.1 Acceptable</strong>

                    <li><strong><span class="insert">(vii)</span></strong><span class="insert"> Apps may enable individual users to give a monetary gift to another individual without using in-app purchase, provided that (a) the gift is a completely optional choice by the giver, and (b) 100% of the funds go to the receiver of the gift.  However, a gift that is connected to or associated at any point in time with receiving digital content or services must use in-app purchase.</span></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

<strong>4.2 Minimum Functionality</strong>
        <ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
            <li><strong>4.2.1</strong> Apps should use APIs and frameworks for their intended purposes and indicate that integration in their app description. For example, the HomeKit framework should provide home automation services; and HealthKit should be used for health and fitness purposes and integrate with the Health app.<span class="insert"> Apps using ARKit should provide rich and integrated augmented reality experiences; merely dropping a model into an AR view or replaying animation is not enough.</span></li>
        </ul>

<strong>4.7<span class="delete">  Third-Party Software  </span><span class="insert"> HTML5 Games, Bots, etc. </span></strong>
        <p>Apps may contain or run code <span class="delete">provided by third party developers</span><span class="insert">that is not embedded in the binary</span> (e.g. HTML5-based games<span class="insert">, bots, etc.</span>), as long as <span class="delete">the </span>code <span class="insert">distribution isn’t the main purpose of the app, the code </span>is not offered in a store or store-like interface, and provided that the software (1) is free or purchased using in-app purchase; (2) only uses capabilities available in a standard WebKit view; your app must use WebKit and JavaScript Core to run third party software and should not attempt to extend or expose native platform APIs to third party software; (3) is offered by developers that have joined the Apple Developer Program and signed the Apple Developer Program License Agreement; and (4) adheres to the terms of these App Review Guidelines (e.g. does not include objectionable content; uses <span class="delete">IAP</span><span class="insert">in-app purchase</span> to unlock features and functionality). You must provide an index of <span class="delete">third party </span>software and metadata available in your app upon request.</p>


    <h2 id="legal">5. Legal</h3>
        <p class="section-intro">Apps must comply with all legal requirements in any location where you make them available (if you’re not sure, check with a lawyer). We know this stuff is complicated, but it is your responsibility to understand and make sure your app conforms with all local laws, not just the guidelines below. And of course, apps that solicit, promote, or encourage criminal or clearly reckless behavior will be rejected.<span class="insert"> In extreme cases, such as apps that are found to facilitate human trafficking and/or the exploitation of children, appropriate authorities will be notified.</span></p>

    <strong>Introduction</strong>
        <ul>


            <li><span class="insert">The App Store is a great way to reach hundreds of millions of people around the world.  If you build an app that you just want to show to family and friends, the App Store isn’t the best way to do that.  Consider Ad Hoc distribution or the Enterprise Program.  If you’re just getting started, learn more about the <a
                    href="/programs/">Apple Developer Program</a>.</span></li>


            <li><span class="delete">If your app looks like it was cobbled together in a few days, or you're trying to get your first practice app into the store to impress your friends, please brace yourself for rejection. We have lots of serious developers who don't want their quality apps to be surrounded by amateur hour.
			We will reject apps for any content or behavior that we believe is over the line. What line, you ask? Well, as a Supreme Court Justice once said, "I'll know it when I see it". And we think that you will also know it when you cross it.
			If you attempt to cheat the system (for example, by trying to trick the review process, steal user data, copy another developer's work, or manipulate ratings) your apps will be removed from the store and you will be expelled from the Developer Program.</span>

    <strong>Before you submit</strong>

        <p>To help your app approval go as smoothly as possible, review the common missteps listed below that can slow
            down
            the review process or trigger a rejection. This doesn’t replace the guidelines or guarantee approval, but
            making
            sure you can check every item on the list is a good start.<span class="insert"> If your app no longer functions as intended or you’re no longer actively supporting it, it will be removed from the App Store.  </span><a

    <strong>1.4 Physical Harm</strong>
        <p>If your app behaves in a way that risks physical harm, we may reject it. For example:</p>

            <li><strong>1.4.1</strong> Medical apps that could provide inaccurate data or information, or that could be

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="insert">Apps must clearly disclose data and methodology to support accuracy claims relating to health measurements, and if the level of accuracy or methodology cannot be validated, we will reject your app.  For example, apps that claim to take x-rays, measure blood pressure, body temperature, blood glucose levels, or blood oxygen levels using only the sensors on the device are not permitted.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="insert">Apps should remind users to check with a doctor in addition to using the app and before making medical decisions. </span>
                    </li>

                </ul>
                If your medical app has received regulatory clearance, please submit a link to that documentation with
                your app.

                isn’t allowed.

            <li><strong>1.4.5</strong> Apps should not urge customers to use their devices in a way that contradicts
                safety documentation for Apple hardware, risking damage to the device or physical harm to people. For
                example, apps should not encourage placing the device under a mattress or pillow while charging<span

    <strong>2.3 Accurate Metadata</strong>

        <ul class="no-bullet">
            <li><strong>2.3.2</strong> If your app includes in-app purchases, make sure your app description,
                screenshots, and previews clearly indicate whether any featured items, levels, subscriptions, etc.
                require additional purchases.<span class="insert"> If you decide to promote in-app purchases on the App Store, ensure that the IAP Display Name and Description are written for a public audience and that your app properly handles the Purchase Intent API so that customers can seamlessly complete the purchase when your app launches.</span>
            </li>
            <li><strong>2.3.3</strong> Screenshots should show the app in use, and not merely the title art, log-in
                page, or splash screen.<span class="insert"> They may also include text overlays and show extended functionality on device, such as Touch Bar.</span>
            </li>
            <li><strong>2.3.7</strong> Choose a unique app name, assign keywords that accurately describe your app, and
                don’t try to pack any of your metadata with trademarked terms, popular app names, or other irrelevant
                phrases just to game the system. App names must be limited to <span class="delete">50</span><span
                        class="insert">30</span> characters and should not include <span class="insert">prices, </span>terms<span
                        class="insert">,</span> or descriptions that are not the name of the app.<span class="insert">  App subtitles are a great way to provide additional context for your app; they must follow our standard metadata rules and should not include inappropriate content, reference other apps, or make unverifiable product claims.</span>
                Apple may modify inappropriate keywords at any time.
            </li>
            <li><strong>2.3.8</strong> Metadata should be appropriate for all audiences, so make sure your<span
                    class="insert"> app and in-app purchase</span> icons, screenshots, and previews adhere to a 4+ age
                rating even if your app is rated higher. For example, if your app is a game that includes violence,
                select images that don’t depict a gruesome death or a gun pointed at a specific character. <span
                        class="insert">Use of terms like “For Kids” and “For Children” in app names is reserved for the Kids Category. </span>Remember
                to ensure your metadata, including app name and icons (small, large, Apple Watch app, etc.), are similar
                to avoid creating confusion.

                displays Activity rings, do not modify the look and feel of the rings themselves or the data
                they represent. The <a

The full diff is listed below, but a few interesting new bits&nbsp;include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>App names must be limited to 50 characters and should not include terms or descriptions that are not the name of the&nbsp;app.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was also mentioned in the “App Store Improvements” email sent to developers on September 1<span class="ord">st</span> and will be enforced for new apps and app&nbsp;updates.</p>
<p>Section 3.2.2 has a new point that I think is worth to&nbsp;notice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apps should allow a user to get what they’ve paid for without performing additional tasks, such as posting on social media, uploading contacts, checking in to the app a certain number of times, etc. <strong>Apps should not force users to rate the app, review the app, download other apps, or take other similar actions in order to access functionality, content, or use of the&nbsp;app.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems to me that many apps and games currently encourage users to rate the app by offering rewards like free coins or similar for doing so. It will be interesting to see if Apple enforce this rule in a way that also prohibits this behavior where users are not forced, but gets&nbsp;rewarded.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And remember that even after your app has been approved, you should update your app to ensure it remains functional and engaging to new and existing customers. Apps that stop working or offer a degraded experience may be removed from the App Store at any&nbsp;time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes Apple will finally start to remove abandoned apps from the App Store. This should be a win for&nbsp;everyone.</p>
</section><p class="changes"><section class="apple">
    <strong>2.3 Accurate Metadata</strong>
    <ul class="no-bullet">
        <li><strong>2.3.4</strong> Previews are a great way for customers to see what your app looks like and what it does. To ensure people understand what they’ll be getting with your app, previews may only use video screen captures of the app itself. <span class="insert">Stickers and iMessage extensions may show the user experience in the Messages app. </span>You can add narration and video or textual overlays to help explain anything that isn’t clear from the video alone.</li>
        <li><strong>2.3.7</strong> Choose a unique app name, assign keywords that accurately describe your app, and don’t try to pack any of your metadata with trademarked terms, popular app names, or other irrelevant phrases just to game the system. <span class="insert">App names must be limited to 50 characters and should not include terms or descriptions that are not the name of the app. </span>Apple may modify inappropriate keywords at any time.</li>

For example, if your app is a meal planning app, you should not incorporate an intent to start a workout, even if the app shares integration with a fitness app.</span></li>
                <li><strong><span class="insert">(ii)</span></strong><span class="insert"> Ensure that the vocabulary and phrases in your plist pertains to your app and the SiriKit functionality of the intents the app has registered for.</span></li>
                <li><strong><span class="insert">(iii)</span></strong><span class="insert"> Resolve the Siri request in the most direct way possible and do not insert ads or other marketing between the request and its fulfillment. Only present interstitial UI when required to complete the task (e.g. asking the user to specify a particular type of workout).</span></li>

Apple announced significant updates for their 4 big platforms: iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. And right after the keynote ended the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">App Store Review Guidelines</a> were also updated. But not just updated… Totally rewritten! The previous 30 sections have been reduce to only 5 sections but the word count has gone up from around 5000 words to over 6000 words.
<br /><br /></p>
<p>This post will not include a diff showing what changed since <a href="http://www.appstorereviewguidelineshistory.com/articles/2016-04-19-carekit-apple-music">the last update in April</a> since basically <em>everything</em> changed.
<br /><br /></p>
<p>From the&nbsp;introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The guiding principle of the App Store is simple - we want to provide a safe experience for users to get apps and a great opportunity for all developers to be successful. We have updated the App Review Guidelines with that principle in mind. The guidelines themselves haven’t changed, but they are better organized and provide more context. On the following pages you will find guidelines arranged into five clear sections: Safety, Performance, Business, Design, and&nbsp;Legal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last week when <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2016/06/the_new_app_store">Apple told journalists that App Store Subscription Pricing would no longer be limited to apps with media content and services</a> there was <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2016/06/app_store_subscription_uncertainty">much uncertainty to what that really meant</a>. The new guidelines actually elaborates on&nbsp;that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Auto-renewing subscriptions should only be offered using in-app purchase and may only be used for periodicals (e.g. newspapers, magazines), business apps (e.g. enterprise, productivity, professional creative, cloud storage), media apps (e.g. video, audio, voice, photo sharing), and other approved services (e.g. dating, dieting,&nbsp;weather)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I guess that means Apple have a whitelist of what kinds of apps will be allowed to use Subscription Pricing.
<br /><br /></p>
<p>Basically you should read the new guidelines from start to end. If you stumble upon new rules that were not mentioned before, then please let us know so we can update this&nbsp;post.</p>

It’s been 6 months since the last update, and the recent <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniOS/Articles/iOS9_3.html">iOS 9.3 release added several new developer APIs</a>; so this update was not unexpected.
<br /><br /></p>
<p>Most significant is perhaps the new section 10.8 that states apps using background location services must provide a reason for doing so. What Apple considers a fair reason is not really clear although the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/index.html"><span class="caps">HIG</span></a> is mentioned.
<br /><br /></p>
<p>Another significant addition is the new section 30 about the Apple Music <span class="caps">API</span> that was introduced in iOS 9.3. As described in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniOS/Articles/iOS9_3.html">iOS 9.3 release note</a> the new <span class="caps">API</span> allows 3<span class="ord">rd</span> party apps to add music to a user’s Apple Music library and play&nbsp;it.</p>
