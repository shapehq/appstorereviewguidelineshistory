It’s been 6 months since the last update, and the recent <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniOS/Articles/iOS9_3.html">iOS 9.3 release added several new developer APIs</a>; so this update was not unexpected.
<br /><br /></p>
<p>Most significant is perhaps the new section 10.8 that states apps using background location services must provide a reason for doing so. What Apple considers a fair reason is not really clear although the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/index.html"><span class="caps">HIG</span></a> is mentioned.
<br /><br /></p>
<p>Another significant addition is the new section 30 about the Apple Music <span class="caps">API</span> that was introduced in iOS 9.3. As described in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniOS/Articles/iOS9_3.html">iOS 9.3 release note</a> the new <span class="caps">API</span> allows 3<span class="ord">rd</span> party apps to add music to a user’s Apple Music library and play&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The update did also include some minor additions mentioning new Apple products such as CareKit and Apple Music in various sections. Additions are highlighted in green&nbsp;below.</p>

The changes listed below are mostly related to the release of the new Apple <span class="caps">TV</span>, but the new Apple Pencil also gets a mention.
<br /><br /></p>
<p>The new section 2.27 is rather confusing in its mention of the new Siri remote without explaining that the section only applies to tvOS apps (which we assume).
<br /><br /></p>
<p>The updated section 3.6 now says that tvOS top shelf extensions must only show content that adhere to the 4+ age rating. This basically means that we should be very careful with using any user generated content for the top&nbsp;shelf.</p>
