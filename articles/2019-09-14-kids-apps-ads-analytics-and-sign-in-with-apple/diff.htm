	<strong>4.2 Minimum Functionality</strong>
		<p>Your app should include features, content, and UI that elevate it beyond a repackaged website.

	<strong><span class="insert">4.8 Sign in with Apple</span></strong>
		<p><span class="insert">Apps that exclusively use a third-party or social login service (such as Facebook Login, Google Sign-In, Sign in with Twitter, Sign In with LinkedIn, Login with Amazon, or WeChat Login) to set up or authenticate the user’s primary account with the app must also offer Sign in with Apple as an equivalent option. A user’s primary account is the account they establish with your app for the purposes of identifying themselves, signing in, and accessing your features and associated services.</span></p>

	<strong>5.1.4 Kids</strong>
		<p>For many reasons, it is critical to use care when dealing with personal data from kids, and we encourage you to carefully review all the requirements for complying with laws like the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), and any <span class="delete">international or local equivalents</span><span class="insert">other applicable regulations or laws</span>.</p>
		<p>Apps may ask for birthdate and parental contact information only for the purpose of complying with these statutes, but must include some useful functionality or entertainment value regardless of a person’s age.</p>
		<p>Apps intended <span class="insert">primarily </span>for kids <span class="delete">may</span><span class="insert">should</span> not include third-party <span class="insert">analytics or third-party </span>advertising<span class="delete"> or</span><span class="insert">.

		<p>Moreover, apps in the Kids Category or those that collect, transmit, or have the capability to share personal information (e.g. name, address, email, location, photos, videos, drawings, the ability to chat, other personal data, or persistent identifiers used in combination with any of the above) from a minor must include a privacy policy and must comply with all applicable children’s privacy statutes.
