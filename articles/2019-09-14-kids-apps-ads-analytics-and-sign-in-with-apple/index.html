<p>Specifically, it is now, in limited cases, permissible to show ads and include third-party analytics in kids apps and creators of kids apps must now comply with all applicable children’s privacy statutes. Newly submitted kids apps must follow these guidelines immediately, while existing apps will have until March 3, 2020 to be fully compliant. Regarding <em>Sign in with Apple</em>, the guidelines now state that any apps that use a third-party login service, e.g. Facebook or Google, must also offer <em>Sign in with Apple</em>.<br/><br/></p>
<p>The complete changes can be seen&nbsp;below:</p>

	<strong>4.2 Minimum Functionality</strong>
		<p>Your app should include features, content, and UI that elevate it beyond a repackaged website.

	<strong><span class="insert">4.8 Sign in with Apple</span></strong>
		<p><span class="insert">Apps that exclusively use a third-party or social login service (such as Facebook Login, Google Sign-In, Sign in with Twitter, Sign In with LinkedIn, Login with Amazon, or WeChat Login) to set up or authenticate the user’s primary account with the app must also offer Sign in with Apple as an equivalent option. A user’s primary account is the account they establish with your app for the purposes of identifying themselves, signing in, and accessing your features and associated services.</span></p>
		<p><span class="insert">Sign in with Apple is not required if:
			</span><ul class="disc margin-top-small">
				<li><span class="insert">Your app exclusively uses your company’s own account setup and sign-in systems.</span></li>
				<li><span class="insert">Your app is an education, enterprise, or business app that requires the user to sign in with an existing education or enterprise account.</span></li>
				<li><span class="insert">Your app uses a government or industry-backed citizen identification system or electronic ID to authenticate users.</span></li>
				<li><span class="insert">Your app is a client for a specific third-party service and users are required to sign in to their mail, social media, or other third-party account directly to access their content.</span></li>

	<strong>5.1.4 Kids</strong>
		<p>For many reasons, it is critical to use care when dealing with personal data from kids, and we encourage you to carefully review all the requirements for complying with laws like the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), and any <span class="delete">international or local equivalents</span><span class="insert">other applicable regulations or laws</span>.</p>
		<p>Apps may ask for birthdate and parental contact information only for the purpose of complying with these statutes, but must include some useful functionality or entertainment value regardless of a person’s age.</p>
		<p>Apps intended <span class="insert">primarily </span>for kids <span class="delete">may</span><span class="insert">should</span> not include third-party <span class="insert">analytics or third-party </span>advertising<span class="delete"> or</span><span class="insert">.

		<p>Moreover, apps in the Kids Category or those that collect, transmit, or have the capability to share personal information (e.g. name, address, email, location, photos, videos, drawings, the ability to chat, other personal data, or persistent identifiers used in combination with any of the above) from a minor must include a privacy policy and must comply with all applicable children’s privacy statutes. For the sake of clarity, the <a href="#kids-category">parental gate requirement</a> for the Kid’s Category is generally not the same as securing parental consent to collect personal data under these privacy statutes.<span class="delete"> Collecting and transmitting data to third parties from apps in</span></p>
