	<strong>1.1 Objectionable Content</strong>
		<p>Apps should not include content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy. Examples of such content include:</p>
		<ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
			<li id="1.1.1"><strong>1.1.1</strong> Defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content, including references or commentary about religion, race, sexual orientation, gender, national/ethnic origin, or other targeted groups, particularly if the app is likely to humiliate, intimidate, or <span class="delete">place</span><span class="insert">harm</span> a targeted individual or group<span class="delete"> in harm’s way</span>. Professional political satirists and humorists are generally exempt from this requirement.</li>
			<li><span class="delete"><strong>1.1.7</strong> App Store Reviews:</span></li>
				<li>
					<span class="delete">App Store customer reviews can be an integral part of the app experience, so you should treat customers with respect when responding to their comments. Keep your responses targeted to the user’s comments and do not include personal information, spam, or marketing in your response. </span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="delete">Use the provided API to prompt users to review your app; this functionality allows customers to provide an App Store rating and review without the inconvenience of leaving your app, and we will disallow custom review prompts.</span>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
	<strong>1.2 User Generated Content</strong>
		<p>Apps with user-generated content or services that end up being used primarily for pornographic content, <span class="insert">Chatroulette-style experiences, </span>objectification of real people (e.g. “hot-or-not” voting), making physical threats, or bullying do not belong on the App Store and may be removed without notice. If your app includes user-generated content from a web-based service, it may display incidental mature “NSFW” content, provided that the content is hidden by default and only displayed when the user turns it on via your website.</p>
		
	<strong>3.1 Payments</strong>
		<ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
			
			<li data-sidenav="3.1.3(b) Multiplatform Services" id="multiplatform-services"><span id="3.1.3b"></span><strong>3.1.3(b) Multiplatform Services:</strong> Apps that operate across multiple platforms may allow users to access content, subscriptions, or features they have acquired <span class="delete">elsewhere</span><span class="insert">in your app on other platforms or your web site</span>, including consumable items in multiplatform games, provided those items are also available as in-app purchases within the app. You must not directly or indirectly target iOS users to use a purchasing method other than in-app purchase, and your general communications about other purchasing methods must not discourage use of in-app purchase.</li>
		</ul>
		
	<strong>4.2 Minimum Functionality</strong>
		<ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
			<li id="4.2.3"><strong>4.2.3</strong>
				<ul class="disc margin-top-small">
					<li>(iii) If your app needs to download additional resources, disclose the size of the download and prompt users before doing so.<span class="delete"> Existing apps must comply with this guideline in any update submitted after January 1, 2019.</span></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		
	<strong>4.3 Spam</strong><p>Don’t create multiple Bundle&nbsp;IDs of the same app. If your app has different versions for specific locations, sports teams, universities, etc., consider submitting a single app and provide the variations using in-app purchase. Also avoid piling on to a category that is already saturated; the App Store has enough fart, burp, flashlight, <span class="insert">fortune telling, dating, </span>and Kama Sutra apps, etc. already. <span class="insert">We will reject these apps unless they provide a unique, high-quality experience. </span>Spamming the store may lead to your removal from the Developer Program.</p></li>
	
	<strong>4.5 Apple Sites and Services</strong>
		<ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
			<li id="4.5.4"><strong>4.5.4</strong> Push Notifications must not be required for the app to function, and should not be used <span class="delete">for advertising, promotions, or direct marketing purposes or </span>to send sensitive personal or confidential information. <span class="insert">Push Notifications should not be used for promotions or direct marketing purposes unless customers have explicitly opted in to receive them via consent language displayed in your app’s UI, and you provide a method in your app for a user to opt out from receiving such messages. </span>Abuse of these services may result in revocation of your privileges.</li>
		</ul>
		
	<strong>4.7 HTML5 Games, Bots, etc.</strong>
		<p>Apps may contain or run code that is not embedded in the binary (e.g. HTML5-based games, bots, etc.), as long as code distribution isn’t the main purpose of the app, the code is not offered in a store or store-like interface, and provided that the software (1) is free or purchased using in-app purchase; (2) only uses capabilities available in a standard WebKit view (e.g. it must open and run natively in Safari without modifications or additional software); your app must use WebKit and JavaScript Core to run third-party software and should not attempt to extend or expose native platform APIs to third-party software; (3) is offered by developers that have joined the <span class="nowrap">Apple Developer</span> Program and signed the <span class="nowrap">Apple Developer</span> Program License Agreement; (4) does not provide access to real money gaming, lotteries, or charitable donations; (5) adheres to the terms of these App Review Guidelines (e.g. does not include objectionable content); and (6) does not <span class="delete">support</span><span class="insert">offer</span> digital <span class="delete">commerce</span><span class="insert">goods or services for sale</span>. Upon request, you must provide an index of software and metadata available in your app. It must include <span class="nowrap">Apple Developer</span> Program Team IDs for the providers of the software along with a URL which App Review can use to confirm that the software complies with the requirements above.</p></li>
		
	<strong>4.8 Sign in with Apple</strong>
		<p>Apps that <span class="delete">exclusively </span>use a third-party or social login service (such as Facebook Login, Google Sign-In, Sign in with Twitter, Sign In with LinkedIn, Login with Amazon, or WeChat Login) to set up or authenticate the user’s primary account with the app must also offer Sign in with Apple as an equivalent option. A user’s primary account is the account they establish with your app for the purposes of identifying themselves, signing in, and accessing your features and associated services.</p>
