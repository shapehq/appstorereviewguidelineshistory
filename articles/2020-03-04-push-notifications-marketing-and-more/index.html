<p>Specifically, Apple now allows for marketing Push Notifications if the user has opted in to these and the guidelines related to <em>Sign in with Apple</em> are now clearer, Apple having removed “exclusively”, which was used in a way that made it sound like you were only required to offer <em>Sign in with Apple</em> if you exclusively used third-party login systems, which is not the case.</br></br></p>
<p>The complete changes can be seen&nbsp;below:</p>
</section><p class="changes"><section class="apple">
  <strong>1.1 Objectionable Content</strong>
  <p>
    Apps should not include content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting,
    intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy.
    Examples of such content include:
  </p>
  <ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
    <li id="1.1.1">
      <strong>1.1.1</strong> Defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited
      content, including references or commentary about religion, race, sexual
      orientation, gender, national/ethnic origin, or other targeted groups,
      particularly if the app is likely to humiliate, intimidate, or
      <span class="delete">place</span><span class="insert">harm</span> a
      targeted individual or group<span class="delete"> in harm’s way</span>.
      Professional political satirists and humorists are generally exempt from
      this requirement.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="delete"><strong>1.1.7</strong> App Store Reviews:</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="delete"
        >App Store customer reviews can be an integral part of the app
        experience, so you should treat customers with respect when responding
        to their comments. Keep your responses targeted to the user’s comments
        and do not include personal information, spam, or marketing in your
        response.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="delete"
        >Use the provided API to prompt users to review your app; this
        functionality allows customers to provide an App Store rating and review
        without the inconvenience of leaving your app, and we will disallow
        custom review prompts.</span
      >
    </li>
  </ul>

  <strong>1.2 User Generated Content</strong>
  <p>
    Apps with user-generated content or services that end up being used
    primarily for pornographic content,
    <span class="insert">Chatroulette-style experiences, </span>objectification
    of real people (e.g. “hot-or-not” voting), making physical threats, or
    bullying do not belong on the App Store and may be removed without notice.
    If your app includes user-generated content from a web-based service, it may
    display incidental mature “NSFW” content, provided that the content is
    hidden by default and only displayed when the user turns it on via your
    website.
  </p>

  <strong>3.1 Payments</strong>
  <ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
    <li
      data-sidenav="3.1.3(b) Multiplatform Services"
      id="multiplatform-services"
    >
      <span id="3.1.3b"></span
      ><strong>3.1.3(b) Multiplatform Services:</strong> Apps that operate
      across multiple platforms may allow users to access content,
      subscriptions, or features they have acquired
      <span class="delete">elsewhere</span
      ><span class="insert"
        >in your app on other platforms or your web site</span
      >, including consumable items in multiplatform games, provided those items
      are also available as in-app purchases within the app. You must not
      directly or indirectly target iOS users to use a purchasing method other
      than in-app purchase, and your general communications about other
      purchasing methods must not discourage use of in-app purchase.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <strong>4.2 Minimum Functionality</strong>
  <ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
    <li id="4.2.3">
      <strong>4.2.3</strong>
      <ul class="disc margin-top-small">
        <li>
          (iii) If your app needs to download additional resources, disclose the
          size of the download and prompt users before doing so.<span
            class="delete"
          >
            Existing apps must comply with this guideline in any update
            submitted after January 1, 2019.</span
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <strong>4.3 Spam</strong>
  <p>
    Don’t create multiple Bundle&nbsp;IDs of the same app. If your app has
    different versions for specific locations, sports teams, universities, etc.,
    consider submitting a single app and provide the variations using in-app
    purchase. Also avoid piling on to a category that is already saturated; the
    App Store has enough fart, burp, flashlight,
    <span class="insert">fortune telling, dating, </span>and Kama Sutra apps,
    etc. already.
    <span class="insert"
      >We will reject these apps unless they provide a unique, high-quality
      experience. </span
    >Spamming the store may lead to your removal from the Developer Program.
  </p>

  <strong>4.5 Apple Sites and Services</strong>
  <ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
    <li id="4.5.4">
      <strong>4.5.4</strong> Push Notifications must not be required for the app
      to function, and should not be used
      <span class="delete"
        >for advertising, promotions, or direct marketing purposes or </span
      >to send sensitive personal or confidential information.
      <span class="insert"
        >Push Notifications should not be used for promotions or direct
        marketing purposes unless customers have explicitly opted in to receive
        them via consent language displayed in your app’s UI, and you provide a
        method in your app for a user to opt out from receiving such messages. </span
      >Abuse of these services may result in revocation of your privileges.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <strong>4.7 HTML5 Games, Bots, etc.</strong>
  <p>
    Apps may contain or run code that is not embedded in the binary (e.g.
    HTML5-based games, bots, etc.), as long as code distribution isn’t the main
    purpose of the app, the code is not offered in a store or store-like
    interface, and provided that the software (1) is free or purchased using
    in-app purchase; (2) only uses capabilities available in a standard WebKit
    view (e.g. it must open and run natively in Safari without modifications or
    additional software); your app must use WebKit and JavaScript Core to run
    third-party software and should not attempt to extend or expose native
    platform APIs to third-party software; (3) is offered by developers that
    have joined the <span class="nowrap">Apple Developer</span> Program and
    signed the <span class="nowrap">Apple Developer</span> Program License
    Agreement; (4) does not provide access to real money gaming, lotteries, or
    charitable donations; (5) adheres to the terms of these App Review
    Guidelines (e.g. does not include objectionable content); and (6) does not
    <span class="delete">support</span><span class="insert">offer</span> digital
    <span class="delete">commerce</span
    ><span class="insert">goods or services for sale</span>. Upon request, you
    must provide an index of software and metadata available in your app. It
    must include <span class="nowrap">Apple Developer</span> Program Team IDs
    for the providers of the software along with a URL which App Review can use
    to confirm that the software complies with the requirements above.
  </p>

  <strong>4.8 Sign in with Apple</strong>
  <p>
    Apps that <span class="delete">exclusively </span>use a third-party or
    social login service (such as Facebook Login, Google Sign-In, Sign in with
    Twitter, Sign In with LinkedIn, Login with Amazon, or WeChat Login) to set
    up or authenticate the user’s primary account with the app must also offer
    Sign in with Apple as an equivalent option. A user’s primary account is the
    account they establish with your app for the purposes of identifying
    themselves, signing in, and accessing your features and associated services.
