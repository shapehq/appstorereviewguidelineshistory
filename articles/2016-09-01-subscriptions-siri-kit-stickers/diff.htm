    <strong>2.3 Accurate Metadata</strong>
    <ul class="no-bullet">
        <li><strong>2.3.4</strong> Previews are a great way for customers to see what your app looks like and what it does. To ensure people understand what they’ll be getting with your app, previews may only use video screen captures of the app itself. <span class="insert">Stickers and iMessage extensions may show the user experience in the Messages app. </span>You can add narration and video or textual overlays to help explain anything that isn’t clear from the video alone.</li>
        <li><strong>2.3.7</strong> Choose a unique app name, assign keywords that accurately describe your app, and don’t try to pack any of your metadata with trademarked terms, popular app names, or other irrelevant phrases just to game the system. <span class="insert">App names must be limited to 50 characters and should not include terms or descriptions that are not the name of the app. </span>Apple may modify inappropriate keywords at any time.</li>

                <li><strong><span class="insert">(i)</span></strong><span class="insert"> Apps integrating SiriKit should only sign up for intents they can handle without the support of an additional app and that users would expect from the stated functionality. For example, if your app is a meal planning app, you should not incorporate an intent to start a workout, even if the app shares integration with a fitness app.</span></li>
                <li><strong><span class="insert">(ii)</span></strong><span class="insert"> Ensure that the vocabulary and phrases in your plist pertains to your app and the SiriKit functionality of the intents the app has registered for.</span></li>
                <li><strong><span class="insert">(iii)</span></strong><span class="insert"> Resolve the Siri request in the most direct way possible and do not insert ads or other marketing between the request and its fulfillment. Only present interstitial UI when required to complete the task (e.g. asking the user to specify a particular type of workout).</span></li>

Keep in mind that you must be able to provide verifiable documentation upon request.
