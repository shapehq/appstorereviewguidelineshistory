            <h2>Updated subscription rules, SiriKit, Stickers and more</h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>This update to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">App Store Review Guidelines</a> is mostly about the new iOS features SiriKit and Stickers, but also includes the previously promised new rules for subscription based apps. The full diff is listed below, but a few interesting new bits&nbsp;include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>App names must be limited to 50 characters and should not include terms or descriptions that are not the name of the&nbsp;app.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was also mentioned in the “App Store Improvements” email sent to developers on September 1<span class="ord">st</span> and will be enforced for new apps and app&nbsp;updates.</p>
<p>Section 3.2.2 has a new point that I think is worth to&nbsp;notice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apps should allow a user to get what they’ve paid for without performing additional tasks, such as posting on social media, uploading contacts, checking in to the app a certain number of times, etc. <strong>Apps should not force users to rate the app, review the app, download other apps, or take other similar actions in order to access functionality, content, or use of the&nbsp;app.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems to me that many apps and games currently encourage users to rate the app by offering rewards like free coins or similar for doing so. It will be interesting to see if Apple enforce this rule in a way that also prohibits this behavior where users are not forced, but gets&nbsp;rewarded.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And remember that even after your app has been approved, you should update your app to ensure it remains functional and engaging to new and existing customers. Apps that stop working or offer a degraded experience may be removed from the App Store at any&nbsp;time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes Apple will finally start to remove abandoned apps from the App Store. This should be a win for&nbsp;everyone.</p>

	<ul class="no-bullet">
		<li><strong>2.3.4</strong> Previews are a great way for customers to see what your app looks like and what it does. To ensure people understand what they’ll be getting with your app, previews may only use video screen captures of the app itself. <span class="insert">Stickers and iMessage extensions may show the user experience in the Messages app. </span>You can add narration and video or textual overlays to help explain anything that isn’t clear from the video alone.</li>
		<li><strong>2.3.7</strong> Choose a unique app name, assign keywords that accurately describe your app, and don’t try to pack any of your metadata with trademarked terms, popular app names, or other irrelevant phrases just to game the system. <span class="insert">App names must be limited to 50 characters and should not include terms or descriptions that are not the name of the app. </span>Apple may modify inappropriate keywords at any time.</li>

	<li><strong><span class="insert">(ii)</span></strong><span class="insert"> Ensure that the vocabulary and phrases in your plist pertains to your app and the SiriKit functionality of the intents the app has registered for.</span></li>
	<li><strong><span class="insert">(iii)</span></strong><span class="insert"> Resolve the Siri request in the most direct way possible and do not insert ads or other marketing between the request and its fulfillment. Only present interstitial UI when required to complete the task (e.g. asking the user to specify a particular type of workout).</span></li>

												<li><strong><span class="insert">(iii)</span></strong><span class="insert"> If we don’t understand what your stickers mean, include a clear explanation in your review notes to avoid any delays in the review process.</span></li>

Keep in mind that you must be able to provide verifiable documentation upon request. Apps with sticker content you don’t have rights to use will be removed from the App Store and repeat offenders will be removed from the Developer Program.
