                <li id="2.3.7"><strong>2.3.7</strong> Choose a unique app name, assign keywords that accurately describe your app, and don’t try to pack any of your metadata with trademarked terms, popular app names, pricing information, or other irrelevant phrases just to game the system.

Metadata such as app names, subtitles, screenshots, and previews</span> should not include prices, terms, or descriptions that are not <span class="delete">the name of the app</span><span class="insert">specific to the metadata type</span>. App subtitles are a great way to provide additional context for your app; they must follow our standard metadata rules and should not include inappropriate content, reference other apps, or make unverifiable product claims.
