        <p>People need to know how to reach you with questions and support issues. Make sure your app and its Support URL include an easy way to contact you; this is particularly important for apps that may be used in the classroom. Failure to include accurate and up-to-date contact information not only frustrates customers, but may violate the law in some countries or regions. Also ensure that Wallet passes include valid contact information from the issuer and are signed with a dedicated certificate assigned to the brand or trademark owner of the pass.</p>

        <p>Apps should implement appropriate security measures to ensure proper handling of user information collected pursuant to the <span class="nowrap">Apple Developer</span> Program License Agreement and these Guidelines (see Guideline 5.1 for more information) and prevent its unauthorized use, disclosure, or access by third parties.</p>

        <p>Customers should know what they’re getting when they download or buy your app, so make sure all your app metadata, including privacy information, your app description, screenshots, and previews accurately reflect the app’s core experience and remember to keep them up-to-date with new versions.</p>

Similarly, marketing your app in a misleading way, such as by promoting content or services that it does not actually offer (e.g. iOS-based virus and malware scanners) or promoting a false price, whether within or outside of the <span class="nowrap">App Store,</span> is grounds for removal of your app from the <span class="nowrap">App Store</span> and termination of your developer account.</li>

If your app is mis-rated, customers might be surprised by what they get, or it could trigger an inquiry from government regulators. If your app includes media that requires the display of content ratings or warnings (e.g. films, music, games, etc.), you are responsible for complying with local requirements in each territory where your app is available.</li>

App names must be limited to 30 characters. Metadata such as app names, subtitles, screenshots, and previews should not include prices, terms, or descriptions that are not specific to the metadata type. App subtitles are a great way to provide additional context for your app; they must follow our standard metadata rules and should not include inappropriate content, reference other apps, or make unverifiable product claims. Apple may modify inappropriate keywords at any time or take other appropriate steps to prevent abuse.</li>

For example, if your app is a game that includes violence, select images that don’t depict a gruesome death or a gun pointed at a specific character. Use of terms like “For Kids” and “For Children” in app metadata is reserved for the Kids Category. Remember to ensure your metadata, including app name and icons (small, large, <span class="nowrap">Apple Watch</span> app, alternate icons, etc.), are similar to avoid creating confusion.</li>

Apps should not rapidly drain battery, generate excessive heat, or put unnecessary strain on device resources. For example, apps should not encourage placing the device under a mattress or pillow while charging or perform excessive write cycles to the solid state drive.

Keep your apps up-to-date and make sure you phase out any deprecated features, frameworks or technologies that will no longer be supported in future versions of an OS.

                    <li><strong>(i)</strong> MusicKit on iOS lets users play <span class="nowrap">Apple Music</span> and their local music library natively from your apps and games. When a user provides permission to their <span class="nowrap">Apple Music</span> account, your app can create playlists, add songs to their library, and play any of the millions of songs in the <span class="nowrap">Apple Music</span> catalog. Users must initiate the playback of an <span class="nowrap">Apple Music</span> stream and be able to navigate using standard media controls such as “play,” “pause,” and “skip.” Moreover, your app may not require payment or indirectly monetize access to the <span class="nowrap">Apple Music</span> service (e.g. in-app purchase, advertising, requesting user info, etc.). Do not download, upload, or enable sharing of music files sourced from the MusicKit APIs, except as explicitly permitted in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/musickit/">MusicKit<span class="loc-en-only"></span></a> documentation.</li>
                    <li><strong>(ii)</strong> Using the MusicKit APIs is not a replacement for securing the licenses you might need for a deeper or more complex music integration. For example, if you want your app to play a specific song at a particular moment, or to create audio or video files that can be shared to social media, you’ll need to contact rights-holders directly to get their permission (e.g. synchronization or adaptation rights) and assets. Cover art and other metadata may only be used in connection with music playback or playlists (including <span class="nowrap">App Store</span> screenshots displaying your app’s functionality), and should not be used in any marketing or advertising without getting specific authorization from rights-holders. Make sure to follow the <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/marketing-on-music/identity-guidelines.html"><span class="nowrap">Apple Music</span> Identity Guidelines<span class="loc-en-only"></span></a> when integrating <span class="nowrap">Apple Music</span> services in your app.</li>

    <p class="section-intro">Apps must comply with all legal requirements in any location where you make them available (if you’re not sure, check with a lawyer). We know this stuff is complicated, but it is your responsibility to understand and make sure your app conforms with all local laws, not just the guidelines below. And of course, apps that solicit, promote, or encourage criminal or clearly reckless behavior will be rejected. In extreme cases, such as apps that are found to facilitate human trafficking and/or the exploitation of children, appropriate authorities will be notified.</p>

                <p>Protecting user privacy is paramount in the Apple ecosystem, and you should use care when handling personal data to ensure you’ve complied with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/protecting_the_user_s_privacy/">privacy best practices<span class="loc-cj"></span></a>, applicable laws, and the terms of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/terms/"><span class="nowrap">Apple Developer</span> Program License Agreement</a>, not to mention customer expectations.

                            <li><strong>(i) Privacy Policies: </strong>All apps must include a link to their privacy policy in the <span class="nowrap">App Store Connect</span> metadata field and within the app in an easily accessible manner. The privacy policy must clearly and explicitly:
                                <ul class="disc">
                                    <li>Identify what data, if any, the app/service collects, how it collects that data, and all uses of that data.</li>
                                    <li>Confirm that any third party with whom an app shares user data (in compliance with these Guidelines)—such as analytics tools, advertising networks and third-party SDKs, as well as any parent, subsidiary or other related entities that will have access to user data—will provide the same or equal protection of user data as stated in the app’s privacy policy and required by these Guidelines.</li>
                                    <li>Explain its data retention/deletion policies and describe how a user can revoke consent and/or request deletion of the user’s data.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>(ii) Permission: </strong>Apps that collect user or usage data must secure user consent for the collection, even if such data is considered to be anonymous at the time of or immediately following collection. Paid functionality must not be dependent on or require a user to grant access to this data. Apps must also provide the customer with an easily accessible and understandable way to withdraw consent. Ensure your purpose strings clearly and completely describe your use of the data. Apps that collect data for a legitimate interest without consent by relying on the terms of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) or similar statute must comply with all terms of that law. Learn more about <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/protecting_the_user_s_privacy/">Requesting Permission<span class="loc-cj"></span></a>.</li>
                            <li><strong>(iii) Data Minimization: </strong>Apps should only request access to data relevant to the core functionality of the app and should only collect and use data that is required to accomplish the relevant task. Where possible, use the out-of-process picker or a share sheet rather than requesting full access to protected resources like Photos or Contacts.</li>
                            <li><strong>(iv) Access: </strong>Apps must respect the user’s permission settings and not attempt to manipulate, trick, or force people to consent to unnecessary data access. For example, apps that include the ability to post photos to a social network must not also require microphone access before allowing the user to upload photos. Where possible, provide alternative solutions for users who don’t grant consent. For example, if a user declines to share Location, offer the ability to manually enter an address.</li>
                            <li id="5.1.1v"><strong>(v) Account Sign-In: </strong>If your app doesn’t include significant account-based features, let people use it without a login. If your app supports account creation, you must also <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/offering-account-deletion-in-your-app/">offer account deletion within the app</a>. Apps may not require users to enter personal information to function, except when directly relevant to the core functionality of the app or required by law. If your core app functionality is not related to a specific social network (e.g. Facebook, WeChat, Weibo, Twitter, etc.), you must provide access without a login or via another mechanism. Pulling basic profile information, sharing to the social network, or inviting friends to use the app are not considered core app functionality. The app must also include a mechanism to revoke social network credentials and disable data access between the app and social network from within the app. An app may not store credentials or tokens to social networks off of the device and may only use such credentials or tokens to directly connect to the social network from the app itself while the app is in use.</li>
                            <li><strong>(vi) </strong>Developers that use their apps to surreptitiously discover passwords or other private data will be removed from the <span class="nowrap">Apple Developer Program.</span></li>
                            <li><strong>(vii) </strong>SafariViewController must be used to visibly present information to users; the controller may not be hidden or obscured by other views or layers. Additionally, an app may not use SafariViewController to track users without their knowledge and consent.</li>
                            <li><strong>(viii) </strong>Apps that compile personal information from any source that is not directly from the user or without the user’s explicit consent, even public databases, are not permitted on the <span class="nowrap">App Store.</span></li>
                            <li><strong>(ix) </strong>Apps that provide services in highly regulated fields (such as banking and financial services, healthcare, gambling, legal cannabis use, and air travel) or that require sensitive user information should be submitted by a legal entity that provides the services, and not by an individual developer. Apps that facilitate the legal sale of cannabis must be geo-restricted to the corresponding legal jurisdiction.</li>
                            <li><strong>(x) </strong>Apps may request basic contact information (such as name and email address) so long as the request is optional for the user, features and services are not conditional on providing the information, and it complies with all other provisions of these guidelines, including limitations on collecting information from kids.</li>

                            <li><strong>(iii) </strong>Apps should not attempt to surreptitiously build a user profile based on collected data and may not attempt, facilitate, or encourage others to identify anonymous users or reconstruct user profiles based on data collected from Apple-provided APIs or any data that you say has been collected in an “anonymized,” “aggregated,” or otherwise non-identifiable way.</li>

                                <p>Apps may ask for birthdate and parental contact information only for the purpose of complying with these statutes, but must include some useful functionality or entertainment value regardless of a person’s age.</p>
