            <h2>New guidelines for Face ID, ARKit, privacy policies and more.</h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>With the imminent release of iOS 11 and the announcement of the iPhone X with Face <span class="caps">ID</span> it was only natural for Apple to update the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">App Store Review Guidelines</a>. But this update is actually rather big and includes many changes that does not relate to the new products as&nbsp;such.</p>
<p>A few notable changes and additions that caught my&nbsp;mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t market your app with features or content it does not have (such as claimed “virus&nbsp;scanners”)</li>
<li>You must support in-app purchases initiated from the App&nbsp;Store</li>
<li>Facial recognition for authentication must be implemented using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/localauthentication/">official Apple <span class="caps">API</span></a>.</li>
<li>Apps may facilitate peer-to-peer payments and are not required to use in-app purchases for such payments as long as no digital content or services are offered in exchange for rhe&nbsp;payment.</li>
<li>“Apps using ARKit should provide rich and integrated augmented reality experiences; merely dropping a model into an <span class="caps">AR</span> view or replaying animation is not&nbsp;enough.”</li>
<li>Section 4.7 changes some wording in the context of downloading and running 3<span class="ord">rd</span> party code from an&nbsp;app.</li>
<li>The list of app types that must include a privacy policy has been extended to also include “apps that utilize ARKit, Camera APIs, Photo APIs, or other software for depth of facial mapping information”. So if your app falls into this category make sure you have the privacy policy in place and save yourself for a&nbsp;rejection.</li>
<li>Data gathered from depth and/or facial mapping tools (e.g. ARKit, Camera APIs, or Photo APIs) may not be used for advertising or other use-based data&nbsp;mining</li>
<li>Don’t visualize activity data in a way that resembles the Activity Rings in Activity&nbsp;control</li>
<li><span class="caps">IAP</span> renamed to in-app purchases everywhere (not all cases included in the diff&nbsp;below)</li>
<li>Some typos were fixed (not all included in the diff&nbsp;below)</li>
<li>Various other changes; Check the details&nbsp;below.</li>
</ul>
</section>
          <p class="changes">
<ul class="no-bullet">
    <li id="objectionable-content" class="margin-top"><strong>1.1 Objectionable Content</strong>
        <ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
            <li><strong>1.1.1</strong> Defamatory <span class="insert">, discriminatory,  </span>or mean-spirited content, including references or commentary about religion, race, sexual orientation, gender, <span class="insert">national/ethnic origin, </span>or other targeted groups, particularly if the app is likely to <span class="insert">humiliate, intimidate, or </span>place a targeted individual or group in harm’s way. Professional political satirists and humorists are generally exempt from this requirement.</li>
            
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>




<ul class="no-bullet">
    <li id="accurate-metadata" class="margin-top"><strong>2.3 Accurate Metadata</strong>
        <ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
            <li><strong>2.3.1</strong> Don’t include any hidden or undocumented features in your app; your app’s functionality should be clear to end-users and App Review. <span class="insert">Similarly, you should not market your app on the App Store or offline as including content or services that it does not actually offer (e.g. iOS-based virus and malware scanners). </span>Egregious or repeated behavior is grounds for removal from the Developer Program. We work hard to make the App&nbsp;Store a trustworthy ecosystem and expect our app developers to follow suit; if you’re dishonest, we don’t want to do business with you.</li>
            <li><strong>2.3.2</strong> If your app includes in-app purchases, make sure your app description, screenshots, and previews clearly indicate whether any featured items, levels, subscriptions, etc. require additional purchases. If you decide to promote in-app purchases on the App Store, ensure that the <span class="delete">IAP</span><span class="insert">in-app purchase</span> Display Name<span class="insert">, Screenshot</span> and Description are <span class="delete">written</span><span class="insert">appropriate</span> for a public audience and that your app properly handles the <span class="delete">Purchase Intent API</span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skpaymenttransactionobserver/2877502-paymentqueue"><span class="insert">SKPaymentTransactionObserver method</span></a> so that customers can seamlessly complete the purchase when your app launches.</li>
            <li><strong>2.3.3</strong> Screenshots should show the app in use, and not merely the title art, log-in page, or splash screen. They may also include text <span class="insert">and image </span>overlays <span class="insert">(e.g. to demonstrate input mechanisms, such as an animated touch point or Apple Pencil) </span>and show extended functionality on device, such as Touch Bar.</li>
        </ul>

            <li><strong><span class="insert">2.5.13 </span></strong><span class="insert"> Apps using facial recognition for account authentication must use </span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/localauthentication/"><span class="insert">LocalAuthentication</span></a><span class="insert"> (and not ARKit or other facial recognition technology), and must use an alternate authentication method for users under 13 years old.</span></li>

                    <li><strong><span class="insert">(vii)</span></strong><span class="insert"> Apps may enable individual users to give a monetary gift to another individual without using in-app purchase, provided that (a) the gift is a completely optional choice by the giver, and (b) 100% of the funds go to the receiver of the gift.  However, a gift that is connected to or associated at any point in time with receiving digital content or services must use in-app purchase.</span></li>

        <ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
            <li><strong>4.2.1</strong> Apps should use APIs and frameworks for their intended purposes and indicate that integration in their app description. For example, the HomeKit framework should provide home automation services; and HealthKit should be used for health and fitness purposes and integrate with the Health app.<span class="insert"> Apps using ARKit should provide rich and integrated augmented reality experiences; merely dropping a model into an AR view or replaying animation is not enough.</span></li>

        <p>Apps may contain or run code <span class="delete">provided by third party developers</span><span class="insert">that is not embedded in the binary</span> (e.g. HTML5-based games<span class="insert">, bots, etc.</span>), as long as <span class="delete">the </span>code <span class="insert">distribution isn’t the main purpose of the app, the code </span>is not offered in a store or store-like interface, and provided that the software (1) is free or purchased using in-app purchase; (2) only uses capabilities available in a standard WebKit view; your app must use WebKit and JavaScript Core to run third party software and should not attempt to extend or expose native platform APIs to third party software; (3) is offered by developers that have joined the Apple Developer Program and signed the Apple Developer Program License Agreement; and (4) adheres to the terms of these App Review Guidelines (e.g. does not include objectionable content; uses <span class="delete">IAP</span><span class="insert">in-app purchase</span> to unlock features and functionality). You must provide an index of <span class="delete">third party </span>software and metadata available in your app upon request.</p>

        <p class="section-intro">Apps must comply with all legal requirements in any location where you make them available (if you’re not sure, check with a lawyer). We know this stuff is complicated, but it is your responsibility to understand and make sure your app conforms with all local laws, not just the guidelines below. And of course, apps that solicit, promote, or encourage criminal or clearly reckless behavior will be rejected.<span class="insert"> In extreme cases, such as apps that are found to facilitate human trafficking and/or the exploitation of children, appropriate authorities will be notified.</span></p>
