    <h1 class="typography-headline">App <span class="delete">Store</span> Review Guidelines</h1>
    <p class="typography-intro">Apps are changing the world, enriching people’s lives, and enabling developers like you to innovate like never before. As a result, the App&nbsp;Store has grown into an exciting and vibrant ecosystem for millions of developers and more than a billion users. Whether you are a first <span class="insert">-</span>time developer or a large team of experienced programmers, we are excited that you are creating apps for <span class="delete">the </span><span class="delete">App Store</span><span class="insert">our platforms,</span> and want to help you understand our guidelines so you can be confident your app will get through the review process quickly.</p>

    <h3 data-sidenav id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
    <p>The guiding principle of the App&nbsp;Store is simple—we want to provide a safe experience for users to get apps and a great opportunity for all developers to be successful. We do this by offering a highly curated App&nbsp;Store where every app is reviewed by experts and an editorial team helps users discover new apps every day. <span class="insert">We also scan each app for malware and other software that may impact user safety, security, and privacy. These efforts have made Apple’s platforms the safest for consumers around the world.</span></p>
    <p><span class="insert">In the European Union, developers can also distribute notarized iOS apps from alternative app marketplaces. Learn more about </span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/"><span class="insert">alternative app marketplaces</span></a><span class="insert"> and </span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/#notarization-for-ios-apps"><span class="insert">Notarization for iOS apps</span></a><span class="insert">. You can see which guidelines apply to Notarization for iOS apps by clicking on “Show Notarization Review Guidelines Only”  in the menu to the left.</span></p>
    <p>For everything else there is always the open Internet. If the App&nbsp;Store model and guidelines <span class="insert">or alternative app marketplaces and Notarization for iOS apps </span>are not best for your app or business idea that’s okay, we provide Safari for a great web experience too.</p>
    <p>On the following pages you will find our latest guidelines arranged into five clear sections: Safety, Performance, Business, Design, and Legal. The App&nbsp;Store is always changing and improving to keep up with the needs of our customers and our products. Your apps should change and improve as well in order to stay on the App&nbsp;Store.</p>
    <p>A few other points to keep in <span class="delete">mind:</span><span class="insert">mind about distributing your app on our platforms:</span></p>
    <ul class="disc top-level">
        <li>We have lots of kids downloading lots of apps. Parental controls work great to protect kids, but you have to do your part too. So know that we’re keeping an eye out for the kids.</li>
        <li>The App&nbsp;Store is a great way to reach hundreds of millions of people around the world. If you build an app that you just want to show to family and friends, the App&nbsp;Store isn’t the best way to do that. Consider using Xcode to install your app on a device for free or use Ad Hoc distribution available to Apple&nbsp;Developer Program members. If you’re just getting started, learn more about the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/">Apple&nbsp;Developer Program</a>.</li>
        <li>We strongly support all points of view being represented on the App&nbsp;Store, as long as the apps are respectful to users with differing opinions and the quality of the app experience is great. We will reject apps for any content or behavior that we believe is over the line. What line, you ask? Well, as a Supreme Court Justice once said, “I’ll know it when I see it”. And we think that you will also know it when you cross it.</li>
        <li>If you attempt to cheat the system (for example, by trying to trick the review process, steal user data, copy another developer’s work, manipulate ratings or App&nbsp;Store discovery) your apps will be removed from the store and you will be expelled from the Apple&nbsp;Developer&nbsp;Program.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for making sure everything in your app complies with these guidelines, including ad networks, analytics services, and third-party SDKs, so review and choose them carefully.</li>
        <li>Some features and technologies that are not generally available to developers may be offered as an entitlement for limited use cases. For example, we offer entitlements for CarPlay&nbsp;Audio, HyperVisor, and Privileged File Operations. Review our documentation on developer.apple.com to learn more about entitlements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We hope these guidelines help you sail through the <span class="delete">App Review</span><span class="insert">review</span> process, and that approvals and rejections remain consistent across the board. This is a living document; new apps presenting new questions may result in new rules at any time. Perhaps your app will trigger this. We love this stuff too, and honor what you do. We’re really trying our best to create the best platform in the world for you to express your talents and make a living, too.</p>

    <h3 data-nr data-sidenav id="safety"><span id="1"></span>1. Safety</h3>
    <p class="section-intro">When people install an app from the App&nbsp;Store, they want to feel confident that it’s safe to do so—that the app doesn’t contain upsetting or offensive content, won’t damage their device, and isn’t likely to cause physical harm from its use. We’ve outlined the major pitfalls below, but if you’re looking to shock and offend people, the App&nbsp;Store isn’t the right place for your app.<span class="insert"> Some of these rules are also included in Notarization for iOS apps. </span></p>

    <li data-nr data-sidenav="2.3 Accurate Metadata" id="accurate-metadata"><span id="2.3"></span><strong>2.3 Accurate Metadata</strong><span class="custom-tooltip-icon"><img src="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/images/key-icon.svg" height="17" class="asr-nr" alt="ASR & NR" />

        <li data-nr id="2.3.1"><strong>2.3.1</strong>
            <ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
                <li data-nr><strong>(a)</strong><span class="custom-tooltip-icon"><img src="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/images/key-icon.svg" height="17" class="asr-nr" alt="ASR & NR" /></span> Don’t include any hidden, dormant, or undocumented features in your app; your app’s functionality should be clear to end users and App&nbsp;Review. All new features, functionality, and product changes must be described with specificity in the Notes for Review section of App&nbsp;Store&nbsp;Connect (generic descriptions will be rejected) and accessible for review. Similarly, marketing your app in a misleading way, such as by promoting content or services that it does not actually offer (e.g. iOS-based virus and malware scanners) or promoting a false price, whether within or outside of the App&nbsp;Store, is grounds for removal of your app from the App&nbsp;Store<span class="insert"> or a block from installing via alternative distribution</span> and termination of your developer account.</li>
                <li><strong>(b)</strong> Egregious or repeated behavior is grounds for removal from the Apple&nbsp;Developer Program. We work hard to make the App&nbsp;Store a trustworthy ecosystem and expect our app developers to follow suit; if you’re dishonest, we don’t want to do business with you.</li>
            </ul>

        <li data-nr id="2.3.8"><strong>2.3.8</strong><span class="custom-tooltip-icon"><img src="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/images/key-icon.svg" height="17" class="asr-nr" alt="ASR & NR" /></span> Metadata should be appropriate for all audiences, so make sure your app and in-app purchase icons, screenshots, and previews adhere to a 4+ age rating even if your app is rated higher. For example, if your app is a game that includes violence, select images that don’t depict a gruesome death or a gun pointed at a specific character. Use of terms like “For Kids” and “For Children” in app metadata is reserved <span class="insert">in the App&nbsp;Store </span>for the Kids&nbsp;Category. Remember to ensure your metadata, including app name and icons (small, large, Apple&nbsp;Watch app, alternate icons, etc.), are similar to avoid creating confusion.</li>
        <li id="2.3.10"><strong>2.3.10</strong> Make sure your app is focused on the iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS or watchOS experience, and don’t include names, icons, or imagery of other mobile platforms <span class="insert">or alternative app marketplaces </span>in your app or metadata, unless there is specific, approved interactive functionality. Make sure your app metadata is focused on the app itself and its experience. Don’t include irrelevant information.</li>

Apps that contain ads must also include the ability for users to report any inappropriate or age-inappropriate ads.</li>

                <li data-nr><strong>(ii)</strong> Using the MusicKit APIs is not a replacement for securing the licenses you might need for a deeper or more complex music integration. For example, if you want your app to play a specific song at a particular moment, or to create audio or video files that can be shared to social media, you’ll need to contact rights-holders directly to get their permission (e.g. synchronization or adaptation rights) and assets. Cover art and other metadata may only be used in connection with music playback or playlists (including <span class="delete">App Store</span> screenshots displaying your app’s functionality), and should not be used in any marketing or advertising without getting specific authorization from rights-holders. Make sure to follow the <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/marketing-on-music/identity-guidelines.html">Apple&nbsp;Music Identity Guidelines<span class="loc-en-only"></span></a> when integrating Apple&nbsp;Music services in your app.</li>
