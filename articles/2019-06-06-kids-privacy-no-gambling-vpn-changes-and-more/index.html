Here’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=06032019j">Apple’s own summary</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guidelines 1.3 and 5.1.4.</strong> In order to help keep kids’ data private, apps in the kids category and apps intended for kids cannot include third-party advertising or analytics software and may not transmit data to third parties. This guideline is now enforced for new apps. Existing apps must follow this guideline by September 3,&nbsp;2019.</li>
<li><strong>Guideline 4.7.</strong> <span class="caps">HTML5</span> games distributed in apps may not provide access to real money gaming, lotteries, or charitable donations, and may not support digital commerce. This functionality is only appropriate for code that’s embedded in the binary and can be reviewed by Apple. This guideline is now enforced for new apps. Existing apps must follow this guideline by September 3,&nbsp;2019.</li>
<li><strong>Guideline 5.4.</strong> Because <span class="caps">VPN</span> provides access to sensitive data, VPN apps may not sell, use, or disclose to third parties any data for any purpose, and must commit to this in their privacy policy. Certain types of apps — such as those for parental control, content blocking, and security — from approved providers may use the NEVPNManager&nbsp;API.</li>
<li><strong>Guideline 5.5. (New)</strong> Because <span class="caps">MDM</span> provides access to sensitive data, MDM apps must request the mobile device management capability, and may only be offered by commercial enterprises, such as business organizations, educational institutions, or government agencies, and, in limited cases, companies utilizing MDM for parental controls. MDM apps may not sell, use, or disclose to third parties any data for any purpose, and must commit to this in their privacy&nbsp;policy.</li>
<li><strong>Guideline 5.1.3(i).</strong> Apps may use a user’s health or fitness data to provide a benefit directly to that user, such as a reduced insurance premium, if the app is submitted by the entity providing the benefit and the data is not shared with a third party. The developer must also disclose to the user the specific health data collected from the&nbsp;device.</li>
<li><strong>Guideline 5.1.1(viii) (New).</strong> Apps that compile information from any source that is not directly from the user or without the user’s explicit consent, even public databases, are not permitted on the App&nbsp;Store.</li>
<li><strong>Guideline 5.1.1(ii).</strong> Apps must get consent for data collection, even if the data is considered anonymous at the time of or immediately following&nbsp;collection.</li>
<li><strong>Guideline 1.1.3.</strong> Apps may not facilitate purchase of&nbsp;ammunition.</li>
<li><strong>Guideline 4.2.7.</strong> Remote desktop clients now include game consoles owned by the user. Software appearing in the client must be fully executed on the host device.
Demo videos of app functionality that is geo-locked or otherwise restricted are not accepted. Developers must provide a fully functional app for&nbsp;review.</li>
</ul>

				<h3 class="typography-subsection-headline">Introduction</h3>
				<p>Apps are changing the world, enriching people’s lives, and enabling developers like you to innovate like never before. As a result, the <span class="nowrap">App Store</span> has grown into an exciting and vibrant ecosystem for millions of developers and more than a billion users. Whether you are a first time developer or a large team of experienced programmers, we are excited that you are creating apps for the <span class="nowrap">App Store</span> and want to help you understand our guidelines so you can be confident your app will get through the review process quickly.</p>
				<p>The guiding principle of the <span class="nowrap">App Store</span> is simple - we want to provide a safe experience for users to get apps and a great opportunity for all developers to be successful. <span class="insert">We do this by offering a highly curated </span><span class="nowrap"><span class="insert">App Store</span></span><span class="insert"> where every app is reviewed by experts and an editorial team helps users discover new apps every day. For everything else there is always the open Internet. If the </span><span class="nowrap"><span class="insert">App Store</span></span><span class="insert"> model and guidelines are not best for your app or business idea that’s okay, we provide Safari for a great web experience too.</span></p>
				<p>On the following pages you will find <span class="insert">our latest </span>guidelines arranged into five clear sections: Safety, Performance, Business, Design, and Legal. <span class="insert">The </span><span class="nowrap"><span class="insert">App Store</span></span><span class="insert"> is always changing and improving to keep up with the needs of our customers and our products. Your apps should change and improve as well in order to stay on the </span><span class="nowrap"><span class="insert">App Store.</span></span></p>
				<p>A few other points to keep in mind:</p>
				<ul class="disc top-level">
					<li>If you attempt to cheat the system (for example, by trying to trick the review process, steal user data, copy another developer’s work, <span class="delete">or </span>manipulate ratings<span class="insert"> or </span><span class="nowrap"><span class="insert">App Store</span></span><span class="insert"> discovery</span>) your apps will be removed from the store and you will be expelled from the Developer Program.</li>
					<li><span class="insert">Some features and technologies that are not generally available to developers may be offered as an entitlement for limited use cases. For example, we offer entitlements for CarPlay&nbsp;Audio, HyperVisor, and Privileged File Operations. Review our documentation on developer.apple.com to learn more about entitlements.</span></li>

<section class="apple">
	<h3 class="typography-subsection-headline" id="before-you-submit">Before You Submit</h3>
	<p>Make sure you:</p>
	<ul class="disc top-level">
		<li>Include detailed explanations of non-obvious features and in-app purchases in the App Review notes, including supporting documentation where appropriate.<span class="delete"> If we’re not able to access part of your app because it’s geo-locked or otherwise restricted, provide a link to a video of the functionality</span></li>
	</ul>
</section>

<section class="apple" id="guidelines">
	<strong>1.1 Objectionable Content</strong>
		<p>Apps should not include content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, <span class="delete">or </span>in exceptionally poor taste<span class="insert">, or just plain creepy</span>. Examples of such content include:</p>
			<ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
				<li id="1.1.3"><strong>1.1.3</strong> Depictions that encourage illegal or reckless use of weapons and dangerous objects, or facilitate the purchase of firearms<span class="insert"> or ammunition</span>.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<strong>1.3 Kids Category</strong>
			<p>Apps in the Kids Category may not include <span class="delete">behavioral</span><span class="insert">third-party</span> advertising <span class="delete">(e</span><span class="insert">or analytics</span>.<span class="delete">g. the advertiser may not serve ads based on the user’s activity), and any contextual ads must be appropriate for young audiences.</span> You should also pay particular attention to privacy laws around the world relating to the collection of data from children online. Be sure to review the <a href="#privacy">Privacy section</a> of these guidelines for more information.</p>

		<strong>1.4 Physical Harm</strong>
			<p>If your app behaves in a way that risks physical harm, we may reject it. For example:</p>
			<ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
				<li id="1.4.3"><strong>1.4.3</strong> Apps that encourage consumption of tobacco<span class="insert"> and vape</span> products, illegal drugs, or excessive amounts of alcohol are not permitted on the <span class="nowrap">App Store.</span> Apps that encourage minors to consume any of these substances will be rejected. Facilitating the sale of marijuana, tobacco, or controlled substances (except for licensed pharmacies) isn’t allowed.</li>
				<li id="1.4.5"><strong>1.4.5</strong> Apps should not urge customers to <span class="insert">participate in activities (like bets, challenges, etc.) or </span>use their devices in a way that <span class="delete">contradicts safety documentation for Apple hardware, risking damage to the device or</span><span class="insert">risks</span> physical harm to <span class="delete">people. For example, apps should not encourage placing the device under a mattress or pillow while charging or perform excessive write cycles to the solid state drive. Review </span><span class="delete">device documentation</span><span class="insert">themselves or others</span>.</li>
			</ul>
</section>

<section class="apple">
	<strong>2.3 Accurate Metadata</strong>
		<p>Customers should know what they’re getting when they download or buy your app, so make sure your app description, screenshots, and previews accurately reflect the app’s core experience and remember to keep them up-to-date with new versions.</p>
		<ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
			<li id="2.3.10"><strong>2.3.10</strong> Make sure your app is focused on the iOS, Mac, <span class="nowrap">Apple TV<span class="delete"> or </span></span><span class="insert"> or </span><span class="nowrap">Apple Watch</span> experience, and don’t include names, icons, or imagery of other mobile platforms in your app or metadata, unless there is specific, approved interactive functionality.<span class="insert"> Make sure your app metadata is focused on the app itself and its experience. Don’t include irrelevant information, including but not limited to information about Apple or the development process.</span></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<strong>2.4 Hardware Compatibility</strong>
		<ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
			<li id="2.4.2"><strong>2.4.2</strong> Design your app to use power efficiently<span class="insert"> and be used in a way that does not risk damage to the device</span>. Apps should not rapidly drain battery, generate excessive heat, or put unnecessary strain on device resources. <span class="insert">For example, apps should not encourage placing the device under a mattress or pillow while charging or perform excessive write cycles to the solid state drive. </span>Apps, including any third <span class="insert">-</span>party advertisements displayed within them, may not run unrelated background processes, such as cryptocurrency mining.</li>
		</ul>
	
	<strong>2.5 Software Requirements</strong>
		<ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
			<li id="2.5.5"><strong>2.5.5</strong> <span class="delete">We will be reviewing on an</span><span class="insert">Apps must be fully functional on</span> IPv6<span class="delete"> network, so if your app isn’t compatible with the IPv6 addressing, it may fail during review</span><span class="insert">-only networks</span>.</li>
			<li id="2.5.14"><strong>2.5.14 </strong> Apps must request explicit user consent and provide a clear visual <span class="insert">and/or audible </span>indication when recording, logging, or otherwise making a record of user activity. This includes any use of the device camera, microphone, <span class="insert">screen recordings, </span>or other user inputs.</li>
		</ul>

<section class="apple">
	<strong>3.1 Payments</strong>
		<ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
												<li id="permissible-uses"><span id="3.1.2a"></span><strong>3.1.2(a) Permissible uses:</strong> If you offer an auto-renewing subscription, you must provide ongoing value to the customer, and the subscription period must last at least seven days and be available across all of the user’s devices. While the following list is not exhaustive, examples of appropriate subscriptions include: new game levels; episodic content; multi-player support; apps that offer consistent, substantive updates; access to large collections of, or continually updated, media content; software as a service (“SAAS”); and cloud support. In addition:
				<ul class="disc margin-top-small">
					<li>Apps that attempt to <span class="insert">scam users will be removed from the </span><span class="nowrap"><span class="insert">App Store.</span></span><span class="insert"> This includes apps that attempt to </span>trick users into purchasing a subscription under false pretenses or engage in bait-and-switch <span class="insert">and scam </span>practices will be removed from the <span class="nowrap">App Store</span> and you may be removed from the <span class="nowrap">Apple Developer</span> Program.

			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<strong>3.2 Other Business Model Issues</strong>
		<p>The lists below are not exhaustive, and your submission may trigger a change or update to our policies, but here are some additional do’s and don’ts to keep in mind:</p>
		<ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
			<li id="unacceptable"><span id="3.2.2"></span><strong>3.2.2 Unacceptable</strong>
				<ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
					<li><strong>(vi)</strong> Apps should allow a user to get what they’ve paid for without performing additional tasks, such as posting on social media, uploading contacts, checking in to the app a certain number of times, etc. Apps should not require users to rate the app, review the app, watch videos, download other apps, tap on advertisements, or take other similar actions in order to access functionality, content, use the app, or receive monetary or other compensation<span class="insert">, including but not limited to gift cards and codes</span>.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

		</ul>
</section>

<section class="apple">
	<strong>4.2 Minimum Functionality</strong>
		<p>Your app should include features, content, and UI that elevate it beyond a repackaged website. If your app is not particularly useful, unique, or “app-like,” it doesn’t belong on the <span class="nowrap">App Store.</span> If your App <span class="delete">doesn't</span><span class="insert">doesn’t</span> provide some sort of lasting entertainment value, <span class="delete">or is just plain creepy, </span>it may not be accepted. Apps that are simply a song or movie should be submitted to the iTunes Store. Apps that are simply a book or game guide should be submitted to the <span class="delete">iBooks</span><span class="insert">Apple Books</span> Store.</p>
		<ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
			<li id="4.2.7"><strong>4.2.7 Remote <span class="delete">Application Mirroring:</span><span class="insert">Desktop Clients:</span></strong>
			<p>If your remote desktop app acts as a mirror of specific software or services rather than a generic mirror of the host device, it must comply with the following:</p>
				<ul class="disc margin-top-small">
					<li>(a) The <span class="insert">app must only connect to a user-owned </span>host device <span class="insert">that </span>is a personal computer <span class="insert">or dedicated game console </span>owned by the user, and both the host <span class="insert">device </span>and client must be connected on a local and LAN-based network.</li>
					<li>(b) Any software or services appearing in the client are fully <span class="delete">rendered on the screen of</span><span class="insert">executed on</span> the host device, <span class="insert">rendered on the screen of the host device, </span>and may not use APIs or platform features beyond what is required to stream the Remote Desktop<span class="insert">.</span></li>
					<li>(c) All account creation and management must be initiated from the host device.</li>
					<li>(d) The UI appearing on the client does not resemble an iOS or <span class="nowrap">App Store</span> view, does not provide a store-like interface, or include the ability to browse, select, or purchase software not already owned or licensed by the user. For the sake of clarity, transactions taking place within mirrored software do not need to use in-app purchase, provided the transactions are processed on the host device.</li>
					<li><span class="insert">(e) Thin clients for cloud-based apps are not appropriate for the </span><span class="nowrap"><span class="insert">App Store.</span></span></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<strong>4.3 Spam</strong><p>Don’t create multiple Bundle IDs of the same app. If your app has different versions for specific locations, sports teams, universities, etc., consider submitting a single app and provide the variations using in-app purchase. Also avoid piling on to a category that is already saturated; the <span class="nowrap">App Store</span> has enough fart, burp, flashlight, and Kama Sutra apps<span class="insert">, etc.</span> already. Spamming the store may lead to your removal from the Developer Program.</p>
	
	<strong>4.7 HTML5 Games, Bots, etc. </strong><p>Apps may contain or run code that is not embedded in the binary (e.g. HTML5-based games, bots, etc.), as long as code distribution isn’t the main purpose of the app, the code is not offered in a store or store-like interface, and provided that the software (1) is free or purchased using in-app purchase; (2) only uses capabilities available in a standard WebKit view (e.g. it must open and run natively in Safari without modifications or additional software); your app must use WebKit and JavaScript Core to run third <span class="insert">-</span>party software and should not attempt to extend or expose native platform APIs to third <span class="insert">-</span>party software; (3) is offered by developers that have joined the <span class="nowrap">Apple Developer</span> Program and signed the <span class="nowrap">Apple Developer</span> Program License Agreement;<span class="delete"> and</span> (4) <span class="insert">does not provide access to real money gaming, lotteries, or charitable donations; (5) </span>adheres to the terms of these App Review Guidelines (e.g. does not include objectionable content)<span class="insert">; and (6) does not support digital commerce</span>. Upon request, you must provide an index of software and metadata available in your app. It must include <span class="nowrap">Apple Developer</span> Program Team IDs for the providers of the software along with a URL which App Review can use to confirm that the software complies with the requirements above.</p>

	<strong>5.1 Privacy</strong>
		<ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
			<li id="data-collection-and-storage"><span id="5.1.1"></span><strong>5.1.1 Data Collection and Storage</strong>
				<ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
					<li><strong>(ii) Permission </strong>Apps that collect user or usage data must secure user consent for the<span class="insert"> collection, even if such data is considered to be anonymous at the time of or immediately following</span> collection. Paid functionality must not be dependent on or require a user to grant access to this data. Apps must also provide the customer with an easily accessible and understandable way to withdraw consent. Ensure your purpose strings clearly and completely describe your use of the data. Apps that collect data for a legitimate interest without consent by relying on the terms of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) or similar statute must comply with all terms of that law. Learn more about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190606000009/https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/core_app/protecting_the_user_s_privacy">Requesting Permission</a>.</li>
					<li><strong><span class="insert">(viii) </span></strong><span class="insert">Apps that compile personal information from any source that is not directly from the user or without the user’s explicit consent, even public databases, are not permitted on the </span><span class="nowrap"><span class="insert">App Store.</span></span></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li id="health-and-health-research"><span id="5.1.3"></span><strong>5.1.3 Health and Health Research</strong>
				<p>Health, fitness, and medical data are especially sensitive and apps in this space have some additional rules to make sure customer privacy is protected:</p>
				<ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
					<li><strong>(i)</strong> Apps may not use or disclose to third parties data gathered in the health, fitness, and medical research context—including from the Clinical Health Records API, HealthKit&nbsp;API, Motion and Fitness, MovementDisorderAPIs, or health-related human subject research—for advertising, marketing, or other use-based data mining purposes other than improving health management, or for the purpose of health research, and then only with permission.<span class="insert"> Apps may, however, use a user’s health or fitness data to provide a benefit directly to that user (such as a reduced insurance premium), provided that the app is submitted by the entity providing the benefit, and the data is not be shared with a third party. You must disclose the specific health data that you are collecting from the device.</span></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li id="kids"><span id="5.1.4"></span><strong>5.1.4 Kids</strong>
				<p><span class="insert">Apps intended for kids may not include third-party advertising or analytics.</span></p>
				<p>Moreover, apps in the Kids Category or those that collect, transmit, or have the capability to share personal information (e.g. name, address, email, location, photos, videos, drawings, the ability to chat, other personal data, or persistent identifiers used in combination with any of the above) from a minor must include a privacy policy and must comply with all applicable children’s privacy statutes. For the sake of clarity, the <a href="#kids-category">parental gate requirement</a> for the Kid’s Category is generally not the same as securing parental consent to collect personal data under these privacy statutes.<span class="insert"> Collecting and transmitting data to third parties from apps in the Kids category is not allowed.</span></p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<strong>5.4 VPN Apps</strong>
		<p>Apps offering VPN services must utilize the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190606000009/https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/nevpnmanager">NEVPNManager API</a> and may only be offered by developers enrolled as an organization. You must make a clear declaration of what user data will be collected and how it will be used<span class="insert"> on an app screen prior to any user action to purchase or otherwise use the service</span>. <span class="insert">Apps offering </span>VPN <span class="insert">services may not sell, use,  or disclose to third parties any data for any purpose, and must commit to this in their privacy policy. VPN </span>apps must not violate local laws, and if you choose to make your VPN app available in a territory that requires a VPN license, you must provide your license information in the App Review Notes field.<span class="insert"> Parental control, content blocking, and security apps, among others, from approved providers may also use the NEVPNManager API. Apps that do not comply with this guideline will be removed from the </span><span class="nowrap"><span class="insert">App Store</span></span><span class="insert"> and you may be removed from the </span><span class="nowrap"><span class="insert">Apple Developer</span></span><span class="insert"> Program.</span></p>

	<strong>5.5 <span class="insert">Mobile Device Management</span></strong>
		<p><span class="insert">Mobile Device Management Apps that offer Mobile Device Management (MDM) services must request this capability from Apple. Such apps may only be offered by commercial enterprises (such as business organizations, educational institutions, or government agencies), and in limited cases, companies using MDM for parental control services. You must make a clear declaration of what user data will be collected and how it will be used on an app screen prior to any user action to purchase or otherwise use the service. MDM apps must not violate local laws. Apps offering MDM services may not sell, use, or disclose to third parties any data for any purpose, and must commit to this in their privacy policy.
