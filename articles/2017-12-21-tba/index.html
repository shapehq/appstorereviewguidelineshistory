Besides some minor clarifications, new sections were introduced&nbsp;about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crypto currencies and ICOs now have a dedicated&nbsp;section.</li>
<li>The ban on template apps is clarified so its now more clear exactly what kinds of apps are affected. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/20/apple-revises-its-controversial-guidelines-on-template-based-apps/">Techcrunch spotted this change too</a>.</li>
<li>There is a few paragraphs on apps available for&nbsp;pre-order.</li>
<li>Details about what is allowed when offering so-called “loot boxes” in&nbsp;games.</li>
<li>Financial apps must come from the financial institutions performing the services or they should at least use public&nbsp;APIs.</li>
<li>A new section on <span class="caps">VPN</span> apps details some rules specific to this app&nbsp;type.</li>

<ul class="no-bullet">
    <li class="margin-top">We
        <span class="insert">strongly support all points of view being represented on the App Store, as long as the apps are respectful to users
            with differing opinions and the quality of the app experience is great. We </span>will reject apps for any content
        or behavior that we believe is over the line. What line, you ask? Well, as a Supreme Court Justice once said, “I'll
        know it when I see it”. And we think that you will also know it when you cross it.</li>

            <span class="insert">, including apps you make available for pre-order,</span> should be final versions with all necessary metadata
            and fully functional URLs included; placeholder text, empty websites, and other temporary content should be scrubbed
            before submission. Make sure your app has been tested on-device for bugs and stability before you submit it,
            and include demo account info (and turn on your back-end service!) if your app includes a login. If you offer
            in-app purchases in your app, make sure they are complete, up-to-date, and visible to the reviewer, or that you
            explain why not in your review notes. Please don’t treat App Review as a software testing service. We will reject
            incomplete app bundles and binaries that crash or exhibit obvious technical problems.</p>

                you decide to promote in-app purchases on the App Store, ensure that the in-app purchase Display Name, Screenshot
                and Description are appropriate for a public audience

                    a pre-order state. If you make material changes to the app (e.g. change business models), you should
                    restart your pre-order sales.
