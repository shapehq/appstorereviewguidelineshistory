<h3 class="typography-subsection-headline">Introduction</h3>

<p>We <span class="insert">strongly support all points of view being represented on the App Store, as long as the apps are respectful to users
            with differing opinions and the quality of the app experience is great. We </span>will reject apps for any content
        or behavior that we believe is over the line. What line, you ask? Well, as a Supreme Court Justice once said, “I'll
        know it when I see it”. And we think that you will also know it when you cross it.</p>

        <strong>2.1 App Completeness</strong>
        <p>Submissions to App Review<span class="insert">, including apps you make available for pre-order,</span> should be final versions with all necessary metadata
            and fully functional URLs included; placeholder text, empty websites, and other temporary content should be scrubbed
            before submission. Make sure your app has been tested on-device for bugs and stability before you submit it,
            and include demo account info (and turn on your back-end service!) if your app includes a login. If you offer
            in-app purchases in your app, make sure they are complete, up-to-date, and visible to the reviewer, or that you
            explain why not in your review notes. Please don’t treat App Review as a software testing service. We will reject
            incomplete app bundles and binaries that crash or exhibit obvious technical problems.</p>

        <strong>2.3 Accurate Metadata</strong>
        <ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
            <li>
                <strong>2.3.2</strong> If your app includes in-app purchases, make sure your app description, screenshots, and previews
                clearly indicate whether any featured items, levels, subscriptions, etc. require additional purchases. If
                you decide to promote in-app purchases on the App Store, ensure that the in-app purchase Display Name, Screenshot
                and Description are appropriate for a public audience
                <span class="insert">, that you follow the guidance found in </span>

                </a>
                <span class="insert">,</span> and that your app properly handles the
                <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skpaymenttransactionobserver/2877502-paymentqueue">SKPaymentTransactionObserver method</a> so that customers can seamlessly complete the purchase when your
                app launches.

                </strong>
                <span class="insert"> Apps you submit for pre-order on the App Store must be complete and deliverable as submitted. Ensure that
                    the app you ultimately release is not materially different from what you advertise while the app is in
                    a pre-order state. If you make material changes to the app (e.g. change business models), you should
                    restart your pre-order sales.

        <strong>2.5 Software Requirements</strong>
        <ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
            <li>
                <strong>2.5.1</strong> Apps may only use public APIs and must run on the currently shipping OS. Learn more about
                <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/">public APIs</a>. Keep your apps up-to-date and make sure you phase out any deprecated features, frameworks
                or technologies that will no longer be supported in future versions of an OS.
                <span class="insert">Apps should use APIs and frameworks for their intended purposes and indicate that integration in their app
                    description. For example, the HomeKit framework should provide home automation services; and HealthKit
                    should be used for health and fitness purposes and integrate with the Health app.</span>
