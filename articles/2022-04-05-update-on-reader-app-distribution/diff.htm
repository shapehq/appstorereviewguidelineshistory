    <p>Once you’ve submitted your app and metadata in <span class="nowrap">App Store Connect</span> and you’re in the review process, here are some things to keep in mind:</p>
    <ul class="disc top-level">
        <li><strong>Rejections</strong>: Our goal is to apply these guidelines fairly and consistently, but nobody’s perfect. If your app has been rejected and you have questions or would like to provide additional information, please use<span class="delete"> the Resolution&nbsp;Center to communicate directly with the</span> <span class="nowrap">App <span class="insert">Store Connect</span></span><span class="insert"> to communicate directly with the </span><span class="nowrap"><span class="insert">App </span>Review</span> team. This may help get your app on the store, and it can help us improve the <span class="nowrap">App Review</span> process or identify a need for clarity in our policies. If you still disagree with the outcome, or would like to suggest a change to the guideline itself, please <a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/app-store/?topic=appeal">submit an appeal</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Bug Fix Submissions</strong>: For apps that are already on the <span class="nowrap">App Store,</span> bug fixes will no longer be delayed over guideline violations except for those related to legal or safety issues. If your app has been rejected, and qualifies for this process, please use<span class="delete"> the Resolution&nbsp;Center to communicate directly with the</span> <span class="nowrap">App <span class="insert">Store Connect</span></span><span class="insert"> to communicate directly with the </span><span class="nowrap"><span class="insert">App </span>Review</span> team indicating that you would like to take advantage of this process and plan to address the issue in your next submission.</li>
