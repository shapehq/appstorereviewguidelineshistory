It is clear that the theme of this update is user privacy and data protection. You can check out all the additions (marked with green) and removals (marked with red) below, but a few noteworthy changes&nbsp;include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apps now must clearly describe new features and changes in the “What’s New” section of the App Store. Several of the large social network companies have been using a practice where they reuse a generic update text for every release and then enable new features remotely on a per-user basis. This appears to no longer be&nbsp;permitted.</li>
<li>Developers are now allowed to provide time based free trials for non-subscription&nbsp;apps.</li>
<li>Several new rules for apps dealing with cryptocurrencies. Apps are not allowed to mine coins, but in return cryptocurrencies no longer need to be&nbsp;“approved”.</li>
<li>New rules for apps and games with advertising. Users now must be able to see all information used to target an ad without leaving the&nbsp;app.</li>
<li>New rules for apps that enable Remote Desktop&nbsp;access.</li>
<li>Emojis are back! Section 4.5.6 says that it is ok to use Unicode characters that render as Apple emojis inside apps and app&nbsp;metadata.</li>
<li>All apps must include a link to their privacy policy in the App Store Connect metadata field and within the&nbsp;app</li>
<li>Apps must respect the user’s permission settings and not attempt to manipulate, trick, or force people to consent to unnecessary data access. For example, apps that include the ability to post photos to a social network must not also require microphone access before allowing the user to upload&nbsp;photos.</li>
<li>Apps that enable sign in using a 3<span class="ord">rd</span> party social network must also include a mechanism to revoke social network credentials and disable data access between the app and social network from within the&nbsp;app.</li>
<li>There is a new Developer Code of Conduct&nbsp;section.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out all the changes yourself&nbsp;below.</p>

<h3 class="typography-subsection-headline">Introduction</h3>


        <p>The guiding principle of the App&nbsp;Store is simple - we want to provide a safe experience for users to get apps
            and a great opportunity for all developers to be successful.
            <span class="delete">We have updated the App Review Guidelines with that principle in mind. The</span>
            <span class="insert">On the following pages you will find</span> guidelines
            <span class="delete">themselves haven’t changed, but they are better organized and provide more context. On the following pages you
                will find guidelines </span>arranged into five clear sections: Safety, Performance, Business, Design, and
            Legal. A few other points to keep in mind:</p>
        <ul class="disc top-level">
            <li>
                <span class="insert">You are responsible for making sure everything in your app complies with these guidelines, including ad networks,
                    analytics services, and third-party SDKs, so review and choose them carefully.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We hope these
            <span class="delete">new </span>guidelines help you sail through the App Review process, and that approvals and rejections
            <span class="delete">are more</span>
            <span class="insert">remain</span> consistent across the board. This is a living document; new apps presenting new questions may result
            in new rules at any time. Perhaps your app will trigger this. We love this stuff too, and honor what you do.
            <span class="delete">We're</span>
            <span class="insert">We’re</span> really trying our best to create the best platform in the world for you to express your talents
            and make a living, too.</p>



        <strong>1.5 Developer Information</strong>
        <p>People need to know how to reach you with questions and support issues. Make sure your
            <span class="insert">app and its </span>Support URL
            <span class="delete">includes</span>
            <span class="insert">include</span> an easy way to
            <span class="delete">reach</span>
            <span class="insert">contact</span> you
            <span class="insert">; this is particularly important for apps that may be used in the classroom</span>. Failure to include accurate
            and up-to-date contact information not only frustrates customers, but may violate the law in some countries.
            Also ensure that Wallet passes include valid contact information from the issuer and are signed with a dedicated
            certificate assigned to the brand or trademark owner of the pass.</p>

        <strong>
            <span class="insert">1.6 Data Security</span>
        </strong>
        <p>
            <span class="insert">Apps should implement appropriate security measures to ensure proper handling of user information collected pursuant
                to the Apple Developer Program License Agreement and these Guidelines (see Guideline 5.1 for more information)
                and prevent its unauthorized use, disclosure, or access by third parties.</span>
        </p>


        <strong>2.3 Accurate Metadata</strong>
        <ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
            <li>
                <strong>2.3.6</strong> Answer the age rating questions in
                <span class="nowrap">
                    <span class="delete">iTunes</span>
                    <span class="insert">App Store</span> Connect</span> honestly so that your app aligns properly with parental controls. If
                your app is mis-rated, customers might be surprised by what they get, or it could trigger an inquiry from
                government regulators.
                <span class="insert"> If your app includes media that requires the display of content ratings or warnings (e.g. films, music, games,
                    etc.), you are responsible for complying with local requirements in each territory where your app is
                    available.
                </span>

                    <span class="insert">2.3.12</span>
                </strong>
                <span class="insert"> Apps must clearly describe new features and product changes in their “What’s New” text. Simple bug fixes,
                    security updates, and performance improvements may rely on a generic description, but more significant
                    changes must be listed in the notes.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>


    <strong>2.4 Hardware Compatibility</strong>
    <ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">

        <li>
            <strong>2.4.2</strong> Design your app to use power efficiently. Apps should not rapidly drain battery, generate excessive
            heat, or put unnecessary strain on device resources.
            <span class="insert"> Apps, including any third party advertisements displayed within them, may not run unrelated background processes,
                such as cryptocurrency mining.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>2.4.4</strong> Apps should never suggest or require a restart of the device
            <span class="insert"> or modifications to system settings unrelated to the core functionality of the application. For example, don’t
                encourage users to turn off Wi-Fi, disable security features, etc</span>.</li>
    </ul>

        <strong>2.5 Software Requirements</strong>
        <ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
            <li>
                <strong>2.5.2</strong> Apps should be self-contained in their bundles, and may not read or write data outside the
                designated container area, nor may they download, install, or execute code
                <span class="insert"> which introduces or changes features or functionality of the app</span>, including other apps.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>2.5.11</strong> SiriKit
                <span class="insert"> and Shortcuts</span>
                <ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
                    <li>
                        <strong>(i)</strong> Apps integrating SiriKit
                        <span class="insert">and Shortcuts </span>should only sign up for intents they can handle without the support of an additional
                        app and that users would expect from the stated functionality. For example, if your app is a meal
                        planning app, you should not incorporate an intent to start a workout, even if the app shares integration
                        with a fitness app.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>(ii)</strong> Ensure that the vocabulary and phrases in your plist pertains to your app and the
                        <span class="delete">SiriKit</span>
                        <span class="insert">Siri</span> functionality of the intents the app has registered for. Aliases must relate directly
                        to your app or company name and should not be generic terms or include third party app names or services.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>(iii)</strong> Resolve the Siri request
                        <span class="insert">or Shortcut </span>in the most direct way possible and do not insert ads or other marketing between
                        the request and its fulfillment. Only
                        <span class="delete">present interstitial UI</span>
                        <span class="insert">request a disambiguation</span> when required to complete the task (e.g. asking the user to specify
                        a particular type of workout).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>2.5.13 </strong> Apps using facial recognition for account authentication must use
                <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/localauthentication/">LocalAuthentication</a> (and not ARKit or other facial recognition technology)
                <span class="insert"> where possible</span>, and must use an alternate authentication method for users under 13 years old.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    <span class="insert">2.5.14 </span>
                </strong>
                <span class="insert"> Apps must request explicit user consent and provide a clear visual indication when recording, logging, or
                    otherwise making a record of user activity. This includes any use of the device camera, microphone, or
                    other user inputs.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    <span class="insert">2.5.15 </span>
                </strong>
                <span class="insert"> Apps that enable users to view and select files should include items from the Files app and the user’s iCloud
                    documents.
                </span>
            </li>
