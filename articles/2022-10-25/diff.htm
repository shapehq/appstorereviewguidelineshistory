        <li>Provide <span class="nowrap"><span class="insert">App Review</span></span><span class="insert"> with full access to your app. If your app includes account-based features, provide either </span>an active demo account <span class="delete">and login information</span><span class="insert">or fully-featured demo mode</span>, plus any other hardware or resources that might be needed to review your app (e.g. login credentials or a sample QR code)</li>

    <span id="2.1"></span><strong>2.1 App Completeness</strong>
    <p>Submissions to <span class="nowrap">App Review,</span> including apps you make available for pre-order, should be final versions with all necessary metadata and fully functional URLs included; placeholder text, empty websites, and other temporary content should be scrubbed before submission. Make sure your app has been tested on-device for bugs and stability before you submit it, and include demo account info (and turn on your back-end service!) if your app includes a login. If you <span class="insert">are unable to provide a demo account due to legal or security obligations, you may include a built-in demo mode in lieu of a demo account with prior approval by Apple. Ensure the demo mode exhibits your app’s full features and functionality. If you </span>offer in-app purchases in your app, make sure they are complete, up-to-date, and visible to the reviewer, or that you explain why not in your review notes. Please don’t treat <span class="nowrap">App Review</span> as a software testing service. We will reject incomplete app bundles and binaries that crash or exhibit obvious technical problems.</p>
