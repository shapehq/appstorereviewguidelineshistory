<p>Mainly, Apple now allows for streaming game services as long as the included games can be downloaded directly from the App Store. Apple has also clarified that so-called “Reader apps”, like Netflix, can offer account creation for free tiers, and they’ve now made it more clear that having hidden, dormant or undocumented features in apps are not allowed, an obvious reference to the Fortnite situation.</br></br></p>
<p>The complete changes can be seen&nbsp;below:</p>
</section><p class="changes"><section class="apple">
	<li data-sidenav="2.3 Accurate Metadata" id="accurate-metadata"><span id="2.3"></span><strong>2.3 Accurate Metadata</strong>
		<p>Customers should know what they’re getting when they download or buy your app, so make sure your app description, screenshots, and previews accurately reflect the app’s core experience and remember to keep them up-to-date with new versions.</p>
		<ul class="no-bullet margin-top-small">
			<li id="2.3.1"><strong>2.3.1</strong> Don’t include any hidden<span class="insert">, dormant,</span> or undocumented features in your app; your app’s functionality should be clear to end<span class="delete">-</span> users and <span class="nowrap">App Review.</span><span class="insert"> All new features, functionality, and product changes must be described with specificity in the Notes for Review section of </span><span class="nowrap"><span class="insert">App Store Connect</span></span><span class="insert"> (generic descriptions will be rejected) and accessible for review.</span> Similarly, you should not market your app on the <span class="nowrap">App Store</span> or offline as including content or services that it does not actually offer (e.g. iOS-based virus and malware scanners). Egregious or repeated behavior is grounds for removal from the Developer Program. We work hard to make the <span class="nowrap">App Store</span> a trustworthy ecosystem and expect our app developers to follow suit; if you’re dishonest, we don’t want to do business with you.</li>
			<li id="2.3.7"><strong>2.3.7</strong> Choose a unique app name, assign keywords that accurately describe your app, and don’t try to pack any of your metadata with trademarked terms, popular app names, <span class="insert">pricing information, </span>or other irrelevant phrases just to game the system. App names must be limited to 30 characters and should not include prices, terms, or descriptions that are not the name of the app. App subtitles are a great way to provide additional context for your app; they must follow our standard metadata rules and should not include inappropriate content, reference other apps, or make unverifiable product claims. Apple may modify inappropriate keywords at any time or take other appropriate steps to prevent abuse.</li>
