            <li><span class="delete">If your app looks like it was cobbled together in a few days, or you're trying to get your first practice app into the store to impress your friends, please brace yourself for rejection. We have lots of serious developers who don't want their quality apps to be surrounded by amateur hour.
			We will reject apps for any content or behavior that we believe is over the line. What line, you ask? Well, as a Supreme Court Justice once said, "I'll know it when I see it". And we think that you will also know it when you cross it.
			If you attempt to cheat the system (for example, by trying to trick the review process, steal user data, copy another developer's work, or manipulate ratings) your apps will be removed from the store and you will be expelled from the Developer Program.</span>

        <ul class="no-bullet">
            <li><strong>2.3.2</strong> If your app includes in-app purchases, make sure your app description,
                screenshots, and previews clearly indicate whether any featured items, levels, subscriptions, etc.
                require additional purchases.<span class="insert"> If you decide to promote in-app purchases on the App Store, ensure that the IAP Display Name and Description are written for a public audience and that your app properly handles the Purchase Intent API so that customers can seamlessly complete the purchase when your app launches.</span>
            </li>
            <li><strong>2.3.3</strong> Screenshots should show the app in use, and not merely the title art, log-in
                page, or splash screen.<span class="insert"> They may also include text overlays and show extended functionality on device, such as Touch Bar.</span>
            </li>
            <li><strong>2.3.7</strong> Choose a unique app name, assign keywords that accurately describe your app, and
                don’t try to pack any of your metadata with trademarked terms, popular app names, or other irrelevant
                phrases just to game the system. App names must be limited to <span class="delete">50</span><span
                        class="insert">30</span> characters and should not include <span class="insert">prices, </span>terms<span
                        class="insert">,</span> or descriptions that are not the name of the app.<span class="insert">  App subtitles are a great way to provide additional context for your app; they must follow our standard metadata rules and should not include inappropriate content, reference other apps, or make unverifiable product claims.</span>
                Apple may modify inappropriate keywords at any time.
            </li>
            <li><strong>2.3.8</strong> Metadata should be appropriate for all audiences, so make sure your<span
                    class="insert"> app and in-app purchase</span> icons, screenshots, and previews adhere to a 4+ age
                rating even if your app is rated higher. For example, if your app is a game that includes violence,
                select images that don’t depict a gruesome death or a gun pointed at a specific character. <span
                        class="insert">Use of terms like “For Kids” and “For Children” in app names is reserved for the Kids Category. </span>Remember
                to ensure your metadata, including app name and icons (small, large, Apple Watch app, etc.), are similar
                to avoid creating confusion.

For example, if you want your app to play a specific song at a particular moment, or to create audio or video files that can be shared to social media, you’ll need to contact rights-holders directly to get their permission (e.g. synchronization or adaptation rights) and assets.  Cover art and other metadata may only be used in connection with music playback or playlists (including App Store screenshots displaying your app’s functionality), and should not be used in any marketing or advertising without getting specific authorization from rights-holders.
