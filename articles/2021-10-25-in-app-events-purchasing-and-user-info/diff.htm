All event metadata must be accurate and pertain to the event itself, rather than the app more generally. Events must happen at the times and dates you select in App Store Connect, including across multiple storefronts. You may monetize your event so long as you follow the rules set forth in Section 3 on Business. And your event deep link must direct users to the proper destination within your app. Read </span><a href="/app-store/in-app-events/"><span class="insert">In-App Events</span></a><span class="insert"> for detailed guidance on acceptable event metadata and event deep links.</span></li>
