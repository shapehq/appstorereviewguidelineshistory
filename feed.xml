      <description>&lt;p&gt;What a keynote! Apple announced significant updates for their 4 big platforms: iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. And right after the keynote ended the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/&quot;&gt;App Store Review Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; were also updated. But not just updated… Totally rewritten! The previous 30 sections have been reduce to only 5 sections but the word count has gone up from around 5000 words to over 6000 words.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will not include a diff showing what changed since &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.appstorereviewguidelineshistory.com/articles/2016-04-19-carekit-apple-music&quot;&gt;the last update in April&lt;/a&gt; since basically &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; changed.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the introduction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guiding principle of the App Store is simple - we want to provide a safe experience for users to get apps and a great opportunity for all developers to be successful. We have updated the App Review Guidelines with that principle in mind. The guidelines themselves haven’t changed, but they are better organized and provide more context. On the following pages you will find guidelines arranged into five clear sections: Safety, Performance, Business, Design, and Legal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week when &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/2016/06/the_new_app_store&quot;&gt;Apple told journalists that App Store Subscription Pricing would no longer be limited to apps with media content and services&lt;/a&gt; there was &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/2016/06/app_store_subscription_uncertainty&quot;&gt;much uncertainty to what that really meant&lt;/a&gt;. The new guidelines actually elaborates on that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auto-renewing subscriptions should only be offered using in-app purchase and may only be used for periodicals (e.g. newspapers, magazines), business apps (e.g. enterprise, productivity, professional creative, cloud storage), media apps (e.g. video, audio, voice, photo sharing), and other approved services (e.g. dating, dieting, weather)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I guess that means Apple have a whitelist of what kinds of apps will be allowed to use Subscription Pricing.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically you should read the new guidelines from start to end. If you stumble upon new rules that were not mentioned before, then please let us know so we can update this post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Apple Music API section, CareKit and other updates</title>
      <link>http://appstorereviewguidelineshistory.com/articles/2016-04-19-carekit-apple-music/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today Apple once again updated the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/&quot;&gt;App Store Review Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been 6 months since the last update, and the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniOS/Articles/iOS9_3.html&quot;&gt;iOS 9.3 release added several new developer APIs&lt;/a&gt;; so this update was not unexpected.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most significant is perhaps the new section 10.8 that states apps using background location services must provide a reason for doing so. What Apple considers a fair reason is not really clear although the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/index.html&quot;&gt;HIG&lt;/a&gt; is mentioned.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another significant addition is the new section 30 about the Apple Music API that was introduced in iOS 9.3. As described in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniOS/Articles/iOS9_3.html&quot;&gt;iOS 9.3 release note&lt;/a&gt; the new API allows 3rd party apps to add music to a user’s Apple Music library and play it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update did also include some minor additions mentioning new Apple products such as CareKit and Apple Music in various sections. Additions are highlighted in green below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Guidelines updated for tvOS apps</title>
      <link>http://appstorereviewguidelineshistory.com/articles/2015-10-21-guidelines-updated-for-tvos-apps/</link>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://appstorereviewguidelineshistory.com/articles/2015-10-21-guidelines-updated-for-tvos-apps/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Along with other releases (iOS 9.1, watchOS 2.0.1 and tvOS GM) Apple silently updated the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/&quot;&gt;App Store Review Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; today. The changes listed below are mostly related to the release of the new Apple TV, but the new Apple Pencil also gets a mention.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new section 2.27 is rather confusing in its mention of the new Siri remote without explaining that the section only applies to tvOS apps (which we assume).
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The updated section 3.6 now says that tvOS top shelf extensions must only show content that adhere to the 4+ age rating. This basically means that we should be very careful with using any user generated content for the top shelf.&lt;/p&gt;

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the release of iOS 9 we expected Apple to make a bunch of changes to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/&quot;&gt;App Store Review Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.appstorereviewguidelineshistory.com/articles/2014-09-03-previews-flagging-privacy-policy-extensions-homekit-healtkit-testflight/&quot;&gt;they did last year&lt;/a&gt;. But this time the only change is that Passbook has been renamed to Wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shortly after customers begin to receive their Apple Watches and &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/27/apple-boasts-over-3500-apple-watch-apps-already-available/&quot;&gt;Apple boasts over 3,500 Watch apps are available&lt;/a&gt;, Apple made two small changes to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/&quot;&gt;App Store Review Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. The new section 10.7 states that watch apps must do more than just telling time. Also a new requirement on Human Subject Research says that the research should have approval from an independant ethics review board.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After the Spring Forward media event earlier this week Apple has updated the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/&quot;&gt;App Store Review Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; with a few changes to the HealthKit so that it also mentions ResearchKit and there is a new paragraph on Apple Pay recurring payments. Finally there is a new paragraph stating that apps downloading media from online services such as YouTube, SoundCloud, and Vimeo etc. must obtain permission from those companies before doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Together with the iOS 8 release Apple updated the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/&quot;&gt;App Store Review Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; with new sections on Extensions, HomeKit, HealtKit and Testflight.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most notably in this set of changes of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/&quot;&gt;App Store Review Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, Apple now allows apps to show a collection of other apps that don’t have to be your own if they form a collection in a way Apple approves. Apps are now also allowed to facilitate transmission of approved virtual currencies. In other words Bitcoin apps are now officially allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
